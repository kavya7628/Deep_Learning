Its damage to cultivated crops has become frequent in the recent past and tea is no exception. Most of the tea growing regions in Sri Lanka receive rains from both north-east and south-west monsoons. However, tea plantations are adversely affected by moisture stress conditions due to uneven distribution of rainfall within the year. The main dry period in most of the tea growing regions extends from early January to about late March. However, those areas which receive mainly the north-east monsoon rains, viz. Uva and some parts of the Low and Mid country, have the rain dry period generally extending from late June to about early September.\\n\\nDuring these dry months, considerable damage can be caused to both young and mature tea, with extensive casualties being observed in young clonal tea during their first and the second year after planting. In order to minimize such damage and ensure early recovery, the following precautionary measures need to be adopted prior to, and following, a drought. The drought effects differ with the growth stage of tea, that is whether it is young tea (before first pruning) or mature tea (after first pruning). Hence drought mitigation measures also should vary according to the stage of growth of the tea.\\n\\n# 1. New clearings tea before the first proper prune\\n\\n# 1.1 Measures to be adopted before and during drought\\n\\n# 1.1.1 Mulching\\n\\nThe inter-rows of new clearings should be thatched with Guatemala or Mana grass well before the monsoon tails off. For this purpose, about 37.5 metric tons per hectare (15 tons per acre) fresh material would be required. This could be obtained from single lopping from one hectare of well-tended grass clearing. Partially decomposed waste materials such as sawdust, paddy husk and refuse tea can be used (at the rate of 15-20 tons/ha) for mulching. They can be applied as a layer 1\\\" - 2\\\" thick, leaving about 6\\\" - 8\\\" from the base of the tea plants. If paddy husk or sawdust are used, they should be mixed or sprayed with urea at the rate of 2-3 kg per 100 kg of material. Mulching should be repeated 2 - 3 times a year depending on the rate of decomposition of the material used.\\n\\n# 1.1.2 Weed control\\n\\nNew clearings should be kept free of weeds during drought. Hence, weeding program should be completed before the onset of the drought. If weeds are present during the drought, they can be slashed down to minimize competition for soil moisture. As plants are under moisture stress, spraying of any herbicide during drought is not recommended.\\n\\n# 1.1.3 Spraying of Sulphate of potash (SOP) or Muriate of potash (MOP) and Kaolin\\n\\nIn order to reduce transpiration by the leaves, 2% SOP or 2% MOP can be sprayed (at the rate of 2 kg/ha in 100 L of water during 1st year; 4 kg/ha in 200 L of water during 2nd year and 8 kg/ha in 400 L of water during 3rd year) using a knapsack sprayer. Spraying should commence at least a month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending on the severity of drought. Urea can also be mixed (2 kg/ha) with SOP or MOP to enhance K.\\n# 1.1 Management Practices During Drought\\n\\n# 1.1.1 Absorption\\n\\nIn plucking fields, spraying should be done immediately after harvesting of flush to ensure proper deposition of spray droplets on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should be avoided since the drip would cause leaf scorch.\\n\\nSpraying of Kaolin (5 - 10 kg of Kaolin in 100 L of water) on to the leaves of young tea plants reduces heat and water loss by transpiration. Spraying should be done soon after drought sets in.\\n\\n# 1.1.4 Irrigation\\n\\nIf water is available, irrigate first year plants at 4 - 7 day intervals with 400 - 500 ml plant application. The volume should be doubled for the second year plants irrigating them at 7 - 10 day intervals.\\n\\n# 1.1.5 Skiffing\\n\\nIf the drought is prolonged and the plants remain wilted in the morning hours, young tea in their second to fourth year from planting can be partially defoliated by giving a light skiff to remove the top most 2\\\" - 3\\\" of foliage.\\n\\n# 1.1.6 Fertilizer Application\\n\\nFertilizer applications should be avoided during dry weather.\\n\\n# 1.1.7 Green Manure Crops\\n\\nSALT hedge rows and other green manure crops inter-planted with tea should be lopped. Cover-crops should be cut back to ground level before the onset of a drought.\\n\\n# 1.1.8 Pest Control\\n\\nMites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather pests can cause considerable damage to tea plants (Please refer TRI Advisory Circulars on pest control for their management).\\n\\n# 1.2 Measures to be Adopted Following a Drought\\n\\n# 1.2.1 Fertilizer Application\\n\\nYoung tea fertilizers should be applied only after the plants have fully recovered from moisture stress and once the new leaves of defoliated plants are fully opened.\\n\\n# 1.2.2 Bringing into Bearing and Plucking\\n\\nBringing into bearing should be done selectively and only after the plants have fully recovered from moisture stress and the severely affected plants have fully refoliated. Second to fourth year plants in plucking should be harvested only after they have fully recovered from moisture stress and resumed flushing. Light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be resorted to during the first few months. Bushes which are severely affected by drought (defoliated) should be rested until they form a healthy canopy.\\n\\n# 1.2.3 Resupplying\\n\\nIt is necessary to give priority for resupplying the vacancies before undertaking any normal replanting programme scheduled for the year. If drought casualties are found in isolated patches,\\n# Mature Tea\\n\\n# Measures to be adopted before and during drought\\n\\n# 2.1.1 Plucking\\n\\nIt is recommended that light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) be practiced during the drought.\\n\\n# 2.1.2 Spraying of Sulphate of Potash (SOP) or Muriate of Potash (MOP)\\n\\nIn order to mitigate drought damage in mature tea by reducing water losses through transpiration, particularly in drought prone areas, foliar application of SOP or MOP prior to anticipated drought is recommended. A 2% solution of SOP or 2% solution of MOP (8 kg in 400 L of water/ha) to be applied using a knapsack sprayer at fortnight intervals, commencing at least one month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending on the severity of drought. 2% Urea (8 kg/ha) can also be mixed with SOP or MOP to enhance K absorption. Spraying should be done immediately after harvesting to ensure proper deposition on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should be avoided since the drip would cause leaf scorch.\\n\\n# 2.1.3 Skiffing\\n\\nIf bushes show symptoms of wilting in the morning, they can be partially defoliated by giving light skiff to remove the topmost 2\\\" - 3\\\" of foliage (below the kolunthu mudichchu).\\n\\n# 2.1.4 Pruning\\n\\nAs a rule, pruning should not be carried out just prior to or during a drought. Dry weather pruning can result in extensive bush debilitation.\\n\\n# 2.1.5 Forking\\n\\nThis operation should be avoided during or just prior to the onset of a drought as it would accelerate loss of soil moisture.\\n\\n# 2.1.6 Weeding\\n\\nFields should be kept free of weeds during a drought. Hence, the weeding programme should be completed before the onset of drought. If weeds are present during drought, they can be slashed down to minimize competition with the tea for soil moisture. Spraying of herbicides during dry weather is not recommended.\\n\\n# 2.1.7 Green manure crops and grasses\\n\\nAll SALT hedge rows and rehabilitation grasses planted in vacant patches in mature tea lands should be lopped prior to a drought.\\n\\n# 2.1.8 Pest control\\n\\nMites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather pests can cause considerable damage to tea bushes (Please refer to TRI Advisory Circulars on pest control series for their management).\\n# 2.2 Measures to be adopted following a drought\\n\\n# 2.2.1 Fertilizer application\\n\\nMature tea bushes affected by drought should be fertilized only after they have fully recovered from moisture stress, i.e. when bushes commence flushing. It is also imperative that the fertilizer application for defoliated bushes is delayed until they have fully refoliated and the first set of new leaves are fully expanded.\\n\\n# 2.2.2 Plucking\\n\\nIn any given field the tea bushes are subjected to varying degrees of drought damage. Light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be adopted until such time that flushing resumes its normal periodicity.\\n\\n# 2.2.3 Pruning\\n\\nPruning of drought affected fields should be delayed until the bushes have fully recovered and produced sufficient foliage. It is also best to rest drought affected fields until adequate root reserves have been accumulated.\\n\\n# 2.2.4 Resupplying vacancies\\n\\nHaving infilled the new clearing areas, the best of the remaining nursery plants should be used to supply vacancies in mature tea fields. Vacancies in seedling tea should be planted with an appropriate soil reconditioning grass and infilled after a lapse of two years.\\n\\n# 3. Other considerations\\n\\nShade trees should not be lopped during dry weather to prevent fire hazards. However, all grass clearings must be lopped prior to a drought.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Adulteration\\n2. Presence of excess moisture. Straight fertilizers or fertilizer mixtures which are hygroscopic or contain hygroscopic components, could absorb moisture and become a slurry; if stored under humid conditions\\n3. Inadequate mixing of the components of a fertilizer mixture\\n4. Segregation of particles of different sizes in the bag containing the mixture during transport and storage\\n5. Presence of impurities\\n6. Incorrect sampling procedure\\n7. Analytical errors This is relatively small\\n\\nFor the results of analysis to be meaningful, it is necessary that great care be taken when sampling is carried out. It is only then the samples would be representative of the bulk of the fertilizer or fertilizer-mixture sampled. Thus, it is important that the following procedure be strictly adhered to in sampling.\\n\\n# Sampling\\n\\nThe number of fertilizer bags to be collected at random for sampling should be determined based on the amount of fertilizer bags in a given store as per Table.\\n\\n|Stock of fertilizer|Percentage of the minimum number of bags taken for sampling|Number of bags|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Less than 2 bags|100|sample both bags|\\n|2-5 bags|60| |\\n|6-10 bags|40|3|\\n|11-20 bags|20|3|\\n|21-60 bags| |2|\\n|61-200 bags|4|3|\\n|201-500 bags|3|8|\\n|501-1000 bags|2|13|\\n|1001 or more bags| |20|\\n# The accepted procedure for obtaining a representative sample of fertilizer is described below:\\n\\n# 3. Methods of sampling\\n\\n# 3.1 Use of a shovel\\n\\nThe bags to be sampled should be selected at random and should be emptied separately on a clean dry surface and blended using a shovel and one shovelful taken from each: The shovelfuls so taken should be then thoroughly mixed and any lumps broken up. From this mixture; a sub sample should be drawn by the process of quartering:\\n\\n# 3.2 Use of a sampling probe\\n\\nUse a sampling probe (details given below) to draw samples from fertilizer bags:\\n\\n1. Lay bags horizontally; open one end and pass the probe diagonally from one end to the other and remove the core.\\n2. From lots of ten bags, take one core from each bag.\\n3. For lots of more than ten bags, select ten bags at random and then take one core from each bag.\\n4. When it is necessary to sample only lots of less than ten bags, take ten cores but at least one core from each of the bags.\\n5. For bulk fertilizer, draw at least ten cores from different points. From this, subsamples should be drawn by the process of quartering as described below.\\n\\nThe sampling probe could be constructed by taking 0.9 m (3 feet) long 5 cm (2 inches) internal diameter conduit piping or PVC tubing: Cut one end of the tubing obliquely to get sharp pointed edge (Figure 1).\\n\\nFigure 1. A diagramatic sketch of a sampling probe (a) and a shovel (b)\\n\\n# Subsampling by the process of quartering\\n\\nIt is required to reduce the quantity of fertilizer to a manageable size prior to submission for analysis. Therefore quartering should be adopted as explained below to subsample the collected fertilizer (Figure 2).\\n\\n1. Heap the fertilizer to form a \\\"cone\\\" on a clean sheet of paper or polythene.\\n2. Flatten the cone and divide into two sections through the centre with a metal spatula or wooden plank.\\n3. Divide each half once more and separate the four quarters into four separate piles or quarters.\\n4. Reject one set of diagonally opposite quarters and mix the remainder.\\n5. Continue the quartering and rejection until the desired quantity of sub sample is obtained.\\n6. Collect the final remainder as representative sub sample.\\n\\nOne kilogram of sub sample is quite sufficient; of which only one-third need be sent for nutrient analysis, one-third should be sent to the supplier and the balance must be retained by the customer.\\n# 5. Labelling\\n\\nThe samples should be carefully and correctly labelled giving the name of the estate, type of fertilizer and the date on which the samples was taken. It must be ensured that the label does not come into contact with the fertilizer sample. This precaution is taken to avoid the labels becoming illegible at the time of arrival at the TRI laboratories or its centres.\\n\\n# 6. Sample despatch\\n\\nThe samples should be sent directly to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories located at following addresses depending on convenience for transport:\\n\\nSoils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Walahanduwa, GalleSoils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Research, Advisory and Extension Centre, PO Box, 130, Hantana, Kandy\\nIt is necessary that the total cost of analysis should be paid prior to commencing analysis. Payments could be made through cheques, postal or money orders drawn in favour of 'Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka' and forward to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories at Hantana, Kandy and Walahanduwa, Galle. Money could also be paid at the cash counter of the Tea Research Institute or its centres at the time of submission of samples for analysis.\\n\\nThe analysis is being done on the strict understanding that neither the Tea Research Board nor the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka will be involved in any litigation, nor will any officers employed by the above Board or any of its Divisions or its centres be required to answer summons to witness in any legal action or dispute arising from the results of this or any other analysis of these or similar samples.\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

This leads to poor use efficiency of soil applied fertilizers in these regions. Recent assessments done in small holder lands in these regions revealed that soil magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S) levels are also significantly low.\\n\\nApplications of mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as Urea, Eppawela rock phosphate and Muriate of potash respectively, are recommended for mature tea fields in 2 to 5 splits per annum. The annual requirement of N is based on the potential yield recommended quantity of dolomite (MgCO3CaCO3) for pH correction at the time of pruning: The recommended quantity of dolomite is to be based on soil pH level in the latter part of the last year of cycle. Dolomite should comply with the specifications given in the TRI Advisory Circular SP3.\\n\\nEven though dolomite is applied, low nutrient retention capacities of soils may not make Mg available for plants throughout the pruning cycle. Furthermore, Mg deficiency could also be induced due to suppression of its uptake by the applications of higher rates of N and K containing fertilizers. These circumstances invariably lead to lack of Mg in soil and affecting healthy plant growth.\\n\\nIn view of above observations, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 were formulated as strategic interventions to improve soil fertility status in the tea small holdings. The suitability of new mixtures were tested in 26 small holder lands along with the other fertilizer mixtures previously recommended by the TRI, covering different Agro-ecological regions in major tea growing areas.\\n\\nBased on the outcomes of adaptive trials, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 are recommended for small holdings in all the tea growing regions in addition to previously recommended fertilizer mixtures for mature VP tea fields in different tea growing regions viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VPIUM 910 and VPIUM 1020 for mid & up country and VPIUva 945 and VPIUva 1055 for the Uva region.\\n\\n|Fertilizer Mixtures|Tea Growing Regions|\\n|---|---|\\n|U834|All Regions|\\n|UT752|All Regions|\\n|VPILC 880|Low Country|\\n|VPILC 1075|Low Country|\\n|VPIUM 910|Mid & Up Country|\\n|VPIUM 1020|Mid & Up Country|\\n|VPIUva 945|Uva Region|\\n|VPIUva 1055|Uva Region|\\nGrowers may select the mixtures to be used primarily based on the soil nutrient status, yield or crop responses. It is advisable to use either UT 752 mixture with 100 kg of dolomite per acre per annum or U 834 mixture if soil Mg and/or S levels are below 60 and 40 milligrams per kilogram (ppm) respectively in all the tea growing regions. However, if soil Mg level is above 60 ppm and S level above 40 ppm, it is appropriate to use regional specific mixtures viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VPMUM 1020 for mid and up country and VPUva 945 and VPMUva 1055 for Uva region.\\n\\n# 1.

Its damage to cultivated crops has become frequent in the recent past and tea is no exception. Most of the tea growing regions in Sri Lanka receive rains from both north-east and south-west monsoons. However, tea plantations are adversely affected by moisture stress conditions due to uneven distribution of rainfall within the year. The main dry period in most of the tea growing regions extends from early January to about late March. However, those areas which receive mainly the north-east monsoon rains, viz. Uva and some parts of the Low and Mid country, have the rain dry period generally extending from late June to about early September.\\n\\nDuring these dry months, considerable damage can be caused to both young and mature tea, with extensive casualties being observed in young clonal tea during their first and the second year after planting. In order to minimize such damage and ensure early recovery, the following precautionary measures need to be adopted prior to, and following, a drought. The drought effects differ with the growth stage of tea, that is whether it is young tea (before first pruning) or mature tea (after first pruning). Hence drought mitigation measures also should vary according to the stage of growth of the tea.\\n\\n# 1. New clearings tea before the first proper prune\\n\\n# 1.1 Measures to be adopted before and during drought\\n\\n# 1.1.1 Mulching\\n\\nThe inter-rows of new clearings should be thatched with Guatemala or Mana grass well before the monsoon tails off. For this purpose, about 37.5 metric tons per hectare (15 tons per acre) fresh material would be required. This could be obtained from single lopping from one hectare of well-tended grass clearing. Partially decomposed waste materials such as sawdust, paddy husk and refuse tea can be used (at the rate of 15-20 tons/ha) for mulching. They can be applied as a layer 1\\\" - 2\\\" thick, leaving about 6\\\" - 8\\\" from the base of the tea plants. If paddy husk or sawdust are used, they should be mixed or sprayed with urea at the rate of 2-3 kg per 100 kg of material. Mulching should be repeated 2 - 3 times a year depending on the rate of decomposition of the material used.\\n\\n# 1.1.2 Weed control\\n\\nNew clearings should be kept free of weeds during drought. Hence, weeding program should be completed before the onset of the drought. If weeds are present during the drought, they can be slashed down to minimize competition for soil moisture. As plants are under moisture stress, spraying of any herbicide during drought is not recommended.\\n\\n# 1.1.3 Spraying of Sulphate of potash (SOP) or Muriate of potash (MOP) and Kaolin\\n\\nIn order to reduce transpiration by the leaves, 2% SOP or 2% MOP can be sprayed (at the rate of 2 kg/ha in 100 L of water during 1st year; 4 kg/ha in 200 L of water during 2nd year and 8 kg/ha in 400 L of water during 3rd year) using a knapsack sprayer. Spraying should commence at least a month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending on the severity of drought. Urea can also be mixed (2 kg/ha) with SOP or MOP to enhance K.\\n# 1.1 Management Practices During Drought\\n\\n# 1.1.1 Absorption\\n\\nIn plucking fields, spraying should be done immediately after harvesting of flush to ensure proper deposition of spray droplets on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should be avoided since the drip would cause leaf scorch.\\n\\nSpraying of Kaolin (5 - 10 kg of Kaolin in 100 L of water) on to the leaves of young tea plants reduces heat and water loss by transpiration. Spraying should be done soon after drought sets in.\\n\\n# 1.1.4 Irrigation\\n\\nIf water is available, irrigate first year plants at 4 - 7 day intervals with 400 - 500 ml plant application. The volume should be doubled for the second year plants irrigating them at 7 - 10 day intervals.\\n\\n# 1.1.5 Skiffing\\n\\nIf the drought is prolonged and the plants remain wilted in the morning hours, young tea in their second to fourth year from planting can be partially defoliated by giving a light skiff to remove the top most 2\\\" - 3\\\" of foliage.\\n\\n# 1.1.6 Fertilizer Application\\n\\nFertilizer applications should be avoided during dry weather.\\n\\n# 1.1.7 Green Manure Crops\\n\\nSALT hedge rows and other green manure crops inter-planted with tea should be lopped. Cover-crops should be cut back to ground level before the onset of a drought.\\n\\n# 1.1.8 Pest Control\\n\\nMites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather pests can cause considerable damage to tea plants (Please refer TRI Advisory Circulars on pest control for their management).\\n\\n# 1.2 Measures to be Adopted Following a Drought\\n\\n# 1.2.1 Fertilizer Application\\n\\nYoung tea fertilizers should be applied only after the plants have fully recovered from moisture stress and once the new leaves of defoliated plants are fully opened.\\n\\n# 1.2.2 Bringing into Bearing and Plucking\\n\\nBringing into bearing should be done selectively and only after the plants have fully recovered from moisture stress and the severely affected plants have fully refoliated. Second to fourth year plants in plucking should be harvested only after they have fully recovered from moisture stress and resumed flushing. Light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be resorted to during the first few months. Bushes which are severely affected by drought (defoliated) should be rested until they form a healthy canopy.\\n\\n# 1.2.3 Resupplying\\n\\nIt is necessary to give priority for resupplying the vacancies before undertaking any normal replanting programme scheduled for the year. If drought casualties are found in isolated patches,\\n# Mature Tea\\n\\n# Measures to be adopted before and during drought\\n\\n# 2.1.1 Plucking\\n\\nIt is recommended that light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) be practiced during the drought.\\n\\n# 2.1.2 Spraying of Sulphate of Potash (SOP) or Muriate of Potash (MOP)\\n\\nIn order to mitigate drought damage in mature tea by reducing water losses through transpiration, particularly in drought prone areas, foliar application of SOP or MOP prior to anticipated drought is recommended. A 2% solution of SOP or 2% solution of MOP (8 kg in 400 L of water/ha) to be applied using a knapsack sprayer at fortnight intervals, commencing at least one month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending on the severity of drought. 2% Urea (8 kg/ha) can also be mixed with SOP or MOP to enhance K absorption. Spraying should be done immediately after harvesting to ensure proper deposition on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should be avoided since the drip would cause leaf scorch.\\n\\n# 2.1.3 Skiffing\\n\\nIf bushes show symptoms of wilting in the morning, they can be partially defoliated by giving light skiff to remove the topmost 2\\\" - 3\\\" of foliage (below the kolunthu mudichchu).\\n\\n# 2.1.4 Pruning\\n\\nAs a rule, pruning should not be carried out just prior to or during a drought. Dry weather pruning can result in extensive bush debilitation.\\n\\n# 2.1.5 Forking\\n\\nThis operation should be avoided during or just prior to the onset of a drought as it would accelerate loss of soil moisture.\\n\\n# 2.1.6 Weeding\\n\\nFields should be kept free of weeds during a drought. Hence, the weeding programme should be completed before the onset of drought. If weeds are present during drought, they can be slashed down to minimize competition with the tea for soil moisture. Spraying of herbicides during dry weather is not recommended.\\n\\n# 2.1.7 Green manure crops and grasses\\n\\nAll SALT hedge rows and rehabilitation grasses planted in vacant patches in mature tea lands should be lopped prior to a drought.\\n\\n# 2.1.8 Pest control\\n\\nMites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather pests can cause considerable damage to tea bushes (Please refer to TRI Advisory Circulars on pest control series for their management).\\n# 2.2 Measures to be adopted following a drought\\n\\n# 2.2.1 Fertilizer application\\n\\nMature tea bushes affected by drought should be fertilized only after they have fully recovered from moisture stress, i.e. when bushes commence flushing. It is also imperative that the fertilizer application for defoliated bushes is delayed until they have fully refoliated and the first set of new leaves are fully expanded.\\n\\n# 2.2.2 Plucking\\n\\nIn any given field the tea bushes are subjected to varying degrees of drought damage. Light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be adopted until such time that flushing resumes its normal periodicity.\\n\\n# 2.2.3 Pruning\\n\\nPruning of drought affected fields should be delayed until the bushes have fully recovered and produced sufficient foliage. It is also best to rest drought affected fields until adequate root reserves have been accumulated.\\n\\n# 2.2.4 Resupplying vacancies\\n\\nHaving infilled the new clearing areas, the best of the remaining nursery plants should be used to supply vacancies in mature tea fields. Vacancies in seedling tea should be planted with an appropriate soil reconditioning grass and infilled after a lapse of two years.\\n\\n# 3. Other considerations\\n\\nShade trees should not be lopped during dry weather to prevent fire hazards. However, all grass clearings must be lopped prior to a drought.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Adulteration\\n2. Presence of excess moisture. Straight fertilizers or fertilizer mixtures which are hygroscopic or contain hygroscopic components, could absorb moisture and become a slurry; if stored under humid conditions\\n3. Inadequate mixing of the components of a fertilizer mixture\\n4. Segregation of particles of different sizes in the bag containing the mixture during transport and storage\\n5. Presence of impurities\\n6. Incorrect sampling procedure\\n7. Analytical errors This is relatively small\\n\\nFor the results of analysis to be meaningful, it is necessary that great care be taken when sampling is carried out. It is only then the samples would be representative of the bulk of the fertilizer or fertilizer-mixture sampled. Thus, it is important that the following procedure be strictly adhered to in sampling.\\n\\n# Sampling\\n\\nThe number of fertilizer bags to be collected at random for sampling should be determined based on the amount of fertilizer bags in a given store as per Table.\\n\\n|Stock of fertilizer|Percentage of the minimum number of bags taken for sampling|Number of bags|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Less than 2 bags|100|sample both bags|\\n|2-5 bags|60| |\\n|6-10 bags|40|3|\\n|11-20 bags|20|3|\\n|21-60 bags| |2|\\n|61-200 bags|4|3|\\n|201-500 bags|3|8|\\n|501-1000 bags|2|13|\\n|1001 or more bags| |20|\\n# The accepted procedure for obtaining a representative sample of fertilizer is described below:\\n\\n# 3. Methods of sampling\\n\\n# 3.1 Use of a shovel\\n\\nThe bags to be sampled should be selected at random and should be emptied separately on a clean dry surface and blended using a shovel and one shovelful taken from each: The shovelfuls so taken should be then thoroughly mixed and any lumps broken up. From this mixture; a sub sample should be drawn by the process of quartering:\\n\\n# 3.2 Use of a sampling probe\\n\\nUse a sampling probe (details given below) to draw samples from fertilizer bags:\\n\\n1. Lay bags horizontally; open one end and pass the probe diagonally from one end to the other and remove the core.\\n2. From lots of ten bags, take one core from each bag.\\n3. For lots of more than ten bags, select ten bags at random and then take one core from each bag.\\n4. When it is necessary to sample only lots of less than ten bags, take ten cores but at least one core from each of the bags.\\n5. For bulk fertilizer, draw at least ten cores from different points. From this, subsamples should be drawn by the process of quartering as described below.\\n\\nThe sampling probe could be constructed by taking 0.9 m (3 feet) long 5 cm (2 inches) internal diameter conduit piping or PVC tubing: Cut one end of the tubing obliquely to get sharp pointed edge (Figure 1).\\n\\nFigure 1. A diagramatic sketch of a sampling probe (a) and a shovel (b)\\n\\n# Subsampling by the process of quartering\\n\\nIt is required to reduce the quantity of fertilizer to a manageable size prior to submission for analysis. Therefore quartering should be adopted as explained below to subsample the collected fertilizer (Figure 2).\\n\\n1. Heap the fertilizer to form a \\\"cone\\\" on a clean sheet of paper or polythene.\\n2. Flatten the cone and divide into two sections through the centre with a metal spatula or wooden plank.\\n3. Divide each half once more and separate the four quarters into four separate piles or quarters.\\n4. Reject one set of diagonally opposite quarters and mix the remainder.\\n5. Continue the quartering and rejection until the desired quantity of sub sample is obtained.\\n6. Collect the final remainder as representative sub sample.\\n\\nOne kilogram of sub sample is quite sufficient; of which only one-third need be sent for nutrient analysis, one-third should be sent to the supplier and the balance must be retained by the customer.\\n# 5. Labelling\\n\\nThe samples should be carefully and correctly labelled giving the name of the estate, type of fertilizer and the date on which the samples was taken. It must be ensured that the label does not come into contact with the fertilizer sample. This precaution is taken to avoid the labels becoming illegible at the time of arrival at the TRI laboratories or its centres.\\n\\n# 6. Sample despatch\\n\\nThe samples should be sent directly to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories located at following addresses depending on convenience for transport:\\n\\nSoils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Walahanduwa, GalleSoils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Research, Advisory and Extension Centre, PO Box, 130, Hantana, Kandy\\nIt is necessary that the total cost of analysis should be paid prior to commencing analysis. Payments could be made through cheques, postal or money orders drawn in favour of 'Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka' and forward to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories at Hantana, Kandy and Walahanduwa, Galle. Money could also be paid at the cash counter of the Tea Research Institute or its centres at the time of submission of samples for analysis.\\n\\nThe analysis is being done on the strict understanding that neither the Tea Research Board nor the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka will be involved in any litigation, nor will any officers employed by the above Board or any of its Divisions or its centres be required to answer summons to witness in any legal action or dispute arising from the results of this or any other analysis of these or similar samples.\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

This leads to poor use efficiency of soil applied fertilizers in these regions. Recent assessments done in small holder lands in these regions revealed that soil magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S) levels are also significantly low.\\n\\nApplications of mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as Urea, Eppawela rock phosphate and Muriate of potash respectively, are recommended for mature tea fields in 2 to 5 splits per annum. The annual requirement of N is based on the potential yield recommended quantity of dolomite (MgCO3CaCO3) for pH correction at the time of pruning: The recommended quantity of dolomite is to be based on soil pH level in the latter part of the last year of cycle. Dolomite should comply with the specifications given in the TRI Advisory Circular SP3.\\n\\nEven though dolomite is applied, low nutrient retention capacities of soils may not make Mg available for plants throughout the pruning cycle. Furthermore, Mg deficiency could also be induced due to suppression of its uptake by the applications of higher rates of N and K containing fertilizers. These circumstances invariably lead to lack of Mg in soil and affecting healthy plant growth.\\n\\nIn view of above observations, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 were formulated as strategic interventions to improve soil fertility status in the tea small holdings. The suitability of new mixtures were tested in 26 small holder lands along with the other fertilizer mixtures previously recommended by the TRI, covering different Agro-ecological regions in major tea growing areas.\\n\\nBased on the outcomes of adaptive trials, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 are recommended for small holdings in all the tea growing regions in addition to previously recommended fertilizer mixtures for mature VP tea fields in different tea growing regions viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VPIUM 910 and VPIUM 1020 for mid & up country and VPIUva 945 and VPIUva 1055 for the Uva region.\\n\\n|Fertilizer Mixtures|Tea Growing Regions|\\n|---|---|\\n|U834|All Regions|\\n|UT752|All Regions|\\n|VPILC 880|Low Country|\\n|VPILC 1075|Low Country|\\n|VPIUM 910|Mid & Up Country|\\n|VPIUM 1020|Mid & Up Country|\\n|VPIUva 945|Uva Region|\\n|VPIUva 1055|Uva Region|\\nGrowers may select the mixtures to be used primarily based on the soil nutrient status, yield or crop responses. It is advisable to use either UT 752 mixture with 100 kg of dolomite per acre per annum or U 834 mixture if soil Mg and/or S levels are below 60 and 40 milligrams per kilogram (ppm) respectively in all the tea growing regions. However, if soil Mg level is above 60 ppm and S level above 40 ppm, it is appropriate to use regional specific mixtures viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VPMUM 1020 for mid and up country and VPUva 945 and VPMUva 1055 for Uva region.\\n\\n# 1.

Introduction\\n\\nBlister blight disease of tea is caused by a fungus (*Exobasidium vexans* Massee) and is spread by wind-borne spores. High relative humidity (85%) is required for spore production and their infection. Therefore, conditions of persistent mist and dew are particularly conducive to high levels of infection. Most importantly, high moisture on the leaf surface favors germination of spores and release. The spores are killed when they are exposed to either direct sunlight or desiccation. The disease is of great economic importance during the rainy seasons at mid and high elevations (2600 m). Blister blight fungus can infect only young succulent leaves and tender stems. As the leaves and stems mature, they become immune to infection.\\n\\n# 2. Disease Management\\n\\nIntegrated disease management inclusive of plant resistance, cultural practices and chemical spraying is emphasized.\\n\\n# 2.1 Resistant Cultivars\\n\\nNo cultivars have so far been found to be totally resistant to this disease. Only gradations of susceptibility have been found in the various cultivars of tea. Growing resistant cultivars is the best option. The amount of money spent on chemical control can be proportionately reduced with the increase in resistance of selected cultivars. To select blister blight resistant cultivars for planting, please refer to Advisory Circular PN 1.\\n\\n# 2.2 Cultural Methods\\n\\nCultural practices are the measures undertaken to prevent and control the disease by manipulating plants and the environment. These practices include the following:\\n\\n1. Shade management: Thinning and removal of excess shade to provide adequate sunlight and ventilation.\\n2. Plucking manipulation: Shorter plucking rounds and hard plucking to remove infected leaves and reduce the amount of inoculum and the rate of spread.\\n3. Good Agricultural Practices: Timely and balanced fertilization avoiding unnecessary succulence of the foliage, and timely weed management in the pruned fields up to tipping to avoid stem blisters.\\n\\n# 2.3 Chemical Methods\\n\\nThe following categories of fungicides, which have protective and curative mode of action, can be used to control the Blister Blight Disease in tea:\\n\\n1. Protective: Copper Fungicides\\n2. Curative: Systemic Fungicides\\n# 2.3.1 Copper Fungicides\\n\\nCopper fungicides, which are protective in their action, have been found to give adequate protection against blister blight in tea. When sprayed, copper deposited on the leaf surface prevents the germination of spores, thereby preventing infection. However, copper will have no effect if applied after the fungus has penetrated the leaf surface.\\n\\nThe main ingredient of these fungicides is metallic copper (Cu) and can be available in the forms of oxides, oxychlorides, hydroxides or sulphates. Their formulations could be either wettable powders (WP), dry-flowable powders (DF), wettable granules (WG) and suspension concentrate (SC). All recommendations are based on copper formulations having 50% copper (w/w) or lower.\\n\\nDifferent dosages are recommended for different formulations due to the differences in fineness of the commercial preparations and their resultant spreadability/miscibility in water. Based on their solubility, they have been categorized into two major groups:\\n\\n|Group (a)|Copper oxides (insoluble in water)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Group (b)|Copper hydroxides, Tribasic copper sulphate (slightly soluble in water)|\\n\\n# 2.3.2 Systemic Fungicides\\n\\nSystemic fungicides have both protective and curative properties. Unlike the protectant fungicides, they can cure an established infection at early stages. The disadvantages of the fungicides are the high costs, potential residues in made tea and the likelihood of the fungus developing resistance to the fungicide.\\n\\nIt is recommended to adopt the following strategies to overcome the disadvantages:\\n\\n1. Use the lowest possible concentration of fungicide as recommended by the TRI based on the disease severity.\\n2. Alternate use of systemic fungicides that belong to different groups, possessing different modes of action with protectant copper fungicides (except for plucking fields).\\n3. Limit the total number of applications per season to a minimum possible, following sufficient sunshine hours (cumulative total of 20 hours sunshine over the previous five days is recommended).\\n4. Avoid a fungicidal spray when there are a minimum of 4 hours of sunshine at a stretch for 5 consecutive days and during heavy rains.\\n\\n# 2.4 Management of Blister Blight in Nurseries\\n\\nSucculent stems and leaves of the nursery plants are attacked by blister blight, affecting the overall growth of the plants. Select cultivars resistant to blister blight for establishing a nursery (please refer Advisory Circular PN1). Avoid dense shade in nurseries during monsoonal weather. Spray fungicides, either individually or as alternative sprays using a knapsack sprayer, as recommended in Advisory Circular PU2. Apply copper fungicides and systemic fungicides.\\n\\n# 2.5 Management of Blister Blight in Young Tea\\n\\nTender young plants are also prone to heavy attacks of blister blight. Repeated heavy infections could seriously damage newly establishing plants. Therefore, it is essential to pay more attention for the control of blister blight at this stage of growth.\\n# 2.6 Management of Blister Blight in Tea Recovering from Pruning\\n\\nOn account of blister blight; the most critical time for a tea bush is during the period it is recovering after pruning. During this time all its leaves and shoots are young and tender. The loss of newly emerging stems and leaves at this stage will cause a serious setback to growth: The regeneration of growth to replace dead shoots is possible only at further expense of food reserves. Therefore, if the pruned bushes are not adequately protected, incidence of blister blight could cause very poor recovery, which may even lead to their death.\\n\\nSchedule lopping of shade trees at the onset of the monsoon and weeding in post-pruned fields as recommended in Advisory Circular PU2. Both copper fungicides and systemic fungicides can be applied in tea fields recovering from pruning: Application of fungicides should commence with the bud break (approximately three weeks from pruning) and be continued up to the time of tipping (approximately three months): For maximum protection; it is preferable to use knapsack sprayers in order to wet all the young foliage and tender stems. The last two applications prior to tipping should be carried out carefully, by making every effort to get the lance into the bush: This would ensure that the tender parts, that would be exposed, following tipping are also protected by the fungicides: The application of systemic fungicides should be terminated 2-3 weeks before tipping in order to avoid fungicide residues in the final product.\\n\\n# 2.7 Management of Blister Blight in Tea in Harvesting\\n\\n# 2.7.1 Cultural Method\\n\\nReduce natural shade by lopping shade trees at the beginning of the monsoons; i.e. April-May, in the Western sector and September/October, in the Eastern sector. This allows maximum available sunshine falling on the plucking table, which in itself has fungicidal properties: In order to improve the bush health, the fields may be rested or lightly plucked intermittently for a period of 6-8 weeks following these practices. Shorter plucking rounds (5-7 days) and hard plucking (up to fish leaf) reduce subsequent blister blight infections.\\n\\n# 2.7.2 Chemical Method\\n\\nOnly copper fungicides; using knapsack sprayers or mist-blowers, are recommended for controlling Blister Blight in tea in harvesting: Spraying should be done on the day following harvesting or immediately thereafter: In the event of harvesting rounds being delayed or extended, the spraying rounds must be made sufficiently flexible, enabling a pre-harvest interval of 7 days with copper fungicides, prior to harvesting.\\n# Effective Control of Disease in Tea Fields\\n\\nBlowers could be used to spray copper fungicides in tea fields in harvesting:\\n\\n# Volume Sprays\\n\\nBoth High Volume Sprays (hand-operated knapsack sprayers) or Low Volume Sprays are important for effective control of the disease:\\n\\n1. Good protection depends on good supervision of spraying operation.\\n2. It is important that the recommended amount of fungicides be sprayed on to the stipulated area for effective control.\\n3. Spraying during continuous heavy rain is not warranted for two reasons. First, there is less likelihood of infection as the spores too could get washed off. Second, any fungicide applied during this time could also get washed off. Cool humid weather with overcast skies is very conducive for infection and spraying is best carried out during such periods. During light drizzles spraying could be undertaken when they are not likely to wash off the fungicides from leaves.\\n4. Spray equipment should be periodically checked and maintained in good condition.\\n5. Wettable powders should be first made into a paste with a little water and then diluted to the required volume.\\n6. Personnel safety should be ensured by wearing personal protective equipment: coverall, gloves, mask, and shoes.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved: No part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying, recording, scanning or information storage and retrieval system without the prior written permission from the Director, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='7b4b5f20-b439-4ac0-a53b-415e8d158f7d', embedding=None, metadata={'filename': 'Advisory_Circular_DM2e_2024.md', 'extension': '.md', 'url': 'https://www.tri.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Advisory_Circular_DM2e_2024.pdf', 'title': 'PROTECTION OF TEA FROM ROOT DISEASES', 'issue_date': Timestamp('2024-02-01 00:00:00')}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"# ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.DM 2\\n\\nIssued in: February 2024\\n\\nSerial No. 05/24\\n\\n# PROTECTION OF TEA FROM ROOT DISEASES\\n\\nThis Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular DM 2 Serial No 2/02 issued in October 2002 and related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 2.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nTea bushes are infected by different types of pathogens resulting in root diseases. Red root disease, Black root disease, Brown root disease, Charcoal root disease, White root disease and Violet root disease are the common root diseases damaging tea plants.\\n\\n# 2. Symptoms and Diagnosis\\n\\nThe above ground symptoms of root diseases are alike. They are always symptoms of water shortage, but they occur at times when the soil is not deficient of water. Their identification therefore depends largely upon recognition of the fungi associated with the plants and their invaded roots.\\n\\n# 2.1 Red Root Disease\\n\\nRed root disease, commonly known as 'Poria root disease' of tea, is caused by a fungus (Poria hypolateritia Berk). This occurs most frequently in tea growing areas over 600 m (2000 ft) in elevation. The disease can appear on solitary bushes or in patches. It usually spreads by means of mycelial strands (fungal threads), which is able to grow through the soil. Therefore, root contact is not essential for the spread of infection.\\n\\nProper diagnosis of the disease in the field is of fundamental importance in its control. The first symptoms are yellowing of the foliage, followed by wilting and the sudden death of a part or the entire bush with the withered leaves remaining attached for several days.\\n\\nThe affected bush must be uprooted with the roots. If the infection is fresh and active the fungal mycelium could be seen as whitish specs on a reddish background, particularly towards the base of the bush. If the infection has been there for some time, these symptoms can be seen only after scraping the root-surface-soil-layers with a knife. The mycelium is initially white, soft and fluffy but turns into smooth thin, flat, dark red cords or sheets, with age. These dark cords are normally inconspicuous. However, when such roots with old infections are soaked in water, the red cords of the mycelium can be recognized. When the disease is at an advanced stage the roots become soft and pulpy, making it difficult to extract from the soil.\\n\\n# 2.2 Black Root Disease\\n\\nThe disease is caused by Rosellinia arcuata and R bunoides. Rosellinia arcuata fungus forms irregular, black, cobwebby cords of mycelium on the root surface. Woolly grey to black mycelium can also be found on the main stem a few inches above the soil surface. Numerous small, white, star-shaped mycelium develop on the surface of the wood, under the bark. Small black points or narrow black strands can be seen on the surface of and embedded in wood infected with R bunoides.\\n\\n# 2.3 Brown Root Disease\\n\\nThe disease is caused by the fungus Phellinus noxius. Its most prominent character is the crust of soil firmly attached to the roots and which cannot easily be knocked or washed off. The presence of a\\n# 2.4 Charcoal Root disease\\n\\nThe disease is caused by *Ustulina zonata and U. deusta*. Roots attacked by this fungus have no visible mycelium on their surface. However, when the bark is removed, large white or brownish white fan-shaped patches of mycelium are seen on the wood surface. Wood is permeated by irregular generally double black bands or lines. The fungus produces a characteristic charcoal-like, black, brittle fructification at the collars or main stems of diseased bushes.\\n\\n# 2.5 White Root Disease\\n\\nThe pathogen is *Rigidoporus microporus*. Roots are covered with stout, rather flat cords of mycelium which run more or less longitudinally and unite with one another to form a network. The mycelium is white-yellowish when fresh and has a reddish tinge. Fructifications are formed on the base - like brackets, semicircular in shape and reddish brown in colour. The disease is common in low county.\\n\\n# 2.6 Violet Root Disease\\n\\nThis is a secondary root disease and is associated with poor soil aeration and water logging conditions. The disease is caused by *Nectria mauriticola*. Roots become roughened due to enlargement of lenticels. Roots appear either inky black or light violet in colour. Under the bark, purplish black flattened mycelial strands (rhizomorphs) with characteristic veinations are found.\\n\\n# 3. Disease Management\\n\\n# 3.1 Cleaning of Infestation\\n\\n# 3.1.1 Small Infected Patches\\n\\nIf only one or a few plants are infected, remove the dead or dying bushes and any adjoining ones that are showing any yellowing of the foliage. Any stumps or trees found within the infested patch must be uprooted. The patch should be deep-forked (30-45 cm) and all pencil thickness should be collected into a pile. All the bushes and any woody material uprooted in the cleaning process must be burnt on the spot if the space is adequate. This is to prevent any possible dissemination of infected material into uninfected areas. Only when that is not possible, the closest possible alternative spot must be chosen for burning them.\\n\\n# 3.1.2 Large/Several-infected Patches\\n\\nA large area may be infected by the disease as one contiguous block or as several small patches of several bushes adjacent to each other. The method of cleaning is essentially similar to that described for cleaning of small patches. If the infected area is staggered and includes several small pockets close to each other, it would be advisable to demarcate the entire area to include all of them into one block. Remove all the bushes and stumps within the demarcated area, with their roots. The patch should be deeply forked (45-60 cm) and all the remaining roots up to pencil-thickness be collected and burnt in situ.\\n\\nIf there are many large patches, do not attempt to clean all of them at once. List the bad sections and treat them first to prevent fast spread and contamination. The entire cleaning and burning operation needs very close supervision.\\n# 3.2 Treatment of Peripheral Bushes\\n\\nAfter the infected area has been thoroughly cleaned, the two rows of bushes surrounding the patch should be treated with a soil drench directed at the area around the collar of bushes using a suitable fungicide (Refer Advisory Circular PU2). Fungicide should be applied when the soil is suitably moist. Repeated applications at 2-3 month intervals up to 3-4 times must be undertaken depending on the performance of peripheral bushes. Care should be taken to avoid surface run off at the time of drenching treatment. It would be advantageous to loosen the soil around the plants with hand fork before treatment with a recommended fungicide.\\n\\nIf for some reason, any of the peripheral bushes develop symptoms of the disease they should be uprooted immediately, taking all the precautions mentioned above and the adjoining bushes be treated with a fungicide as before. This process of observation and uprooting should continue until no more symptoms appear and the disease is not spreading any more.\\n\\n# 3.3 Planting of Grass\\n\\nWhen the cleaning up operation is over; the patch should be planted with Mana grass for a minimum period of two years before planting tea.\\n\\n# 3.4 Treatment of Infills\\n\\nAt the end of rehabilitation period, the patch could be planted with tea immediately followed by drenching treatment. The rate of application in the first two rounds (at 2-3 month intervals) can be at the rate of 250 ml per plant which should be increased up to 300-350 ml per plant in the subsequent two rounds. Please refer Advisory Circular PU2 for recommended fungicides. Cleaning of diseased patches should be started two years prior to pruning; so that the vacancies can be infilled in the pruning year.\\n\\n# 3.5 Treatment of Areas to be Replanted\\n\\nShould be properly identified. Dying bushes in areas earmarked for uprooting for replanting with tea. The cause of death or any areas suspected and or confirmed to be affected by a root disease must be demarcated and cleaned first taking all the precautions mentioned for containing the disease. It is best that these areas are marked out for future identification so that the necessary follow up treatments (as indicated before) can be properly undertaken after planting of tea.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\nThe Red Rust disease is caused by an alga *Cephaleuros parasiticus* Karst. Red Rust attacks both young and mature teas in the lowcountry up to an elevation of 600 m (2000 ft) amsl. Though this can be encountered above 600 ft, it does not cause any economic damage. The disease is usually more severe on teas that grow under suboptimal growing conditions; but occasionally vigorously growing, high-yielding tea cultivars too have been found to be badly attacked. Diseased branches have also been seen on old seedling bushes growing in fields with a good cover of tea. On mature tea, the disease is particularly bad on the peripheral branches, which show marked chlorosis at certain times of the year.\\n\\nBy and large, the main predisposing factor appears to be shallow, quartzy soil, often accompanied by underlying hard pan of kabook and gravel. The disease is also severe on tea growing on ill-drained and alkaline soils. A gradual neglect of cultivation practices is also responsible for disease outbreaks. Frequent spells of drought predispose young tea to Red Rust, especially in the early years. Inadequate or complete absence of shade is another factor favouring the disease.\\n\\n# 2. Symptoms and Diagnosis\\n\\nRed rust causes severe damage to young tea by attacking and killing stem tissues in patches. Affected patches on the stem become most noticeable when the alga produces its fructifications, which appear during the month of April to July on stems up to about two years of age. These patches appear brick-red or orange in colour. The patches are oval to oblong in shape. During August to March, the lesions appear purplish in colour; there are no fruiting hairs at this time, but longitudinal cracks may be seen on the surface. Severely affected stems on weak bushes die back. The leaves produced above show a characteristic variegation with yellow or white patches, which mimics discolourations caused by mutations that are more common at higher elevations.\\n\\nThe disease is also common on the older leaves. Affected patches are usually circular and are usually about 5-7 mm in diameter. In some instances, they can be long and oval, running along the entire length of the midrib. The damage caused to the plant by the leaf spots is negligible.\\n\\nInfection takes place mostly during the fruiting period by means of spores, which are dispersed by wind or rain. Repeated attacks gradually weaken the bush with a consequent reduction in crop. Bushes that are severely attacked by Red Rust can be easily recognized by their scanty appearance. Such bushes recover poorly after pruning.\\n\\n# 3. Management of Red Rust\\n\\n# 3.1 Cultural Methods\\n\\nAs Red Rust is more often serious only on weak plants, strengthening the host by good agricultural practices should help minimize the damage caused by the disease. This could be achieved by one or more of the following approaches:\\n\\n- By improving soil condition: If drainage is the main limiting factor; improve drainage to promote deeper rooting.\\n- If the conditions are limited due to an underlying hard pan, deep forking will...\\n# 3.2 Chemical Methods\\n\\nFungicidal spraying is recommended for Red Rust control. Copper fungicides have provided very good results. For effective control, spray a fungicide as recommended in Advisory Circular PU2 about three rounds during the year. It is suggested that for young tea, the first spray be applied in late April, the second about four weeks later in May, and the third, in June. For good control, it is essential to wet the green stems and the older wood with the spray solution, on which the alga is sporulating.\\n\\nFor mature tea, the first spray application should be given soon after pruning, the second at tipping and third about four weeks later. It is advisable to remove all the trailing peripheral branches during pruning. Full benefits of spraying can be achieved only if spraying is continued for two to three successive years.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\nStem and branch canker caused by fungi of family Botryosphaeriaceae, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Botryosphaeria mamane & Botryosphaeria dothidea (generally known as Macrophoma theicola Petch representing one of the anamorphic genus) is in common occurrence in mid and low country tea lands. The increase in the incidence of stem canker in the low country is attributed to several factors. The most important of them are:\\n\\n- The prolonged periods of dry weather experienced in the recent past; Severe attacks of Macrophoma are normally associated with dry weather conditions.\\n- Planting of cultivars specially TRI 2023, TRI 2026 and TRI 4042 in tea lands with inferior soil conditions such as gravelly and rocky.\\n- Planting undertaken without due attention given to soil conditions, soil rehabilitation, establishment of shade and the use and availability of thatching materials. The association of one or more of these factors result in the establishment of unthrifty plants in the field. When followed by dry weather; these plants become very vulnerable to attacks by Macrophoma.\\n\\n# 2. Symptoms and Diagnosis\\n\\nThe disease first appears as slightly sunken, dark patches on the red wood of branches of about pencil thickness. These patches are usually oval, running longitudinally along the stem for a few centimeters. The fungus kills the bark over these patches, which then turn black and soft and later separate from the wood. The fungus is usually arrested after it kills small areas of the bark. Callus develops around the edges of the dead patches or cankers.\\n\\nIn mild attacks the cankers are completely callused over within a few months. But in severe cases callus formation is usually incomplete and the fungus may renew its activity after some months and kill the cankered branches completely. In cankers, which have not healed over completely, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) may be found in the dead bark tissues, which release spores that could start fresh infections.\\n\\nIn some cases the bark is blackened and killed uniformly down to the base of the branch and the disease then continues on to the main stem. The branch dies when the fungus completely encircles a branch and if this happens at the base of the main stem the entire plant will be killed. In the affected shoots, the leaves become yellow, wither and ultimately fall off. This type of attack is common in young tea, which had not been cut back.\\n\\nThe fungus Macrophoma theicola also attacks the older stems of mature bushes and causes typical cankers. It usually attacks the upper surface of horizontal branches, killing the bark and discoloring the wood. After some time, the dead bark peels off from the wood and wood-rot sets in. As this takes place in the interior of the bush, the disease is not noticed until pruning and by that time the canker may have reached an advanced state. Latent infections can be in the field without visible canker on stems.\\n# 3 Management of Stem and Branch Cankers\\n\\nIt has been found that the disease cannot be controlled by the planting of resistant cultivars or by the exclusive use of fungicides. An integrated system of control has been found to be most suitable. These will have to be invariably combined with measures to conserve soil moisture during dry weather periods. No tea cultivar has been found to be completely resistant to the disease under conditions of severe moisture stress.\\n\\n# 3.1 Cultural Methods\\n\\nIt is important that the incidence of the disease should be kept to a minimum, up to the time of the first prune. Infection of the main stem and primary branches should be prevented if the plant is to survive and be productive in the coming years. To achieve this;\\n\\n# In New Clearings\\n\\n- Avoid planting in areas where the soil is poor (gravelly and rocky soil):\\n- It is important to follow all the soil conservation measures during replanting as recommended:\\n- A good stand of shade should be established prior to planting tea.\\n- Do not undertake to replant an area larger than that can be handled.\\n- Before planting a new clearing, ensure that sufficient thatching material is available to completely thatch the entire area during the dry periods.\\n- Please refer to Advisory Circular PN for selection of cultivars that are resistant to stem and branch canker disease.\\n\\n# In Mature Tea\\n\\n- As in the case of young tea, a good stand of shade will reduce the incidence of the disease.\\n- The disease is usually noticed at the time of pruning: This therefore is the best time to get rid of the cankered branches.\\n- The cankered branches should be removed just below the canker; followed by wound dressing (refer Advisory Circular PU 2) of cut ends. At pruning time, attempts should be made to remove as much cankered branches as possible. In instances where the entire bush is affected those should be uprooted and burnt: The vacancies thus created must be supplied with cultivars resistant to canker (refer Advisory Circular PN 1).\\n\\n# 3.2 Chemical Methods\\n\\nAny appropriate systemic fungicide together with above cultural measures have been found to be effective in reducing the incidence of the stem and branch canker. In new clearings the fungicides should be applied with a knapsack sprayer, from the time of planting, once in 2-3 months.

Introduction\\n\\nThe fungus Phomopsis theae attacks tea plants in immature new clearings (up to 8 years) and the tender shoots of mature seedling teas and tea cultivars, in areas over 1200 m (4000 ft) in elevation. In all cases, infection takes place during dry weather conditions. Collar canker and bush dieback caused by Fusarium solani species complex infects both young and mature bushes regardless of elevation.\\n\\n# 2. Symptoms and Diagnosis\\n\\nThose bushes that are infected at the collar start to show general yellowing of the entire foliage: These symptoms become heightened with the onset of rains when they fail to recover; compared to an adjacent healthy bush. Upon uprooting, such plants will show near complete or complete girdling at the collar, depending on the intensity of yellowing: This could give the impression that the disease starts with the rains.\\n\\nInfection takes place through leaf scars, wounds or directly by penetration of the bark in plants; which have a shallow rooting habit; or in plants growing in unsuitable soils. Similarly, poorly developed nursery plants having weak root systems are also prone to attack. Infections over a large area is uncommon unless the area has poor, gravelly or clayey soil with underlying slab rock or unless very susceptible tea cultivars are used. Infections are usually sporadic and occasional, and patchy infections are a rarity: thinning of branches. Flowering and fruiting are common on infected bushes. Irregular canker is found at the collar region. Cankers caused by F. solani species complex cause premature leaf yellowing and leaf fall followed by older cankers having raised margin. Crakes and peeling off of the bark appear at the collar region at soil level or just below: The exposed cambium and wood were discolored giving a tan, brown or black color: Bushes die gradually.\\n\\n# 3. Control of Collar and Branch Cankers\\n\\nAn integrated system of control has been found to be the most suitable. These will have to be invariably combined with measures to conserve soil moisture during dry weather periods. The following measures are recommended to raise plants, which can withstand infection:\\n\\n# 3.1 Cultural Methods\\n\\n# (a) Nursery Practices\\n\\nIt is necessary to raise healthy and uniformly grown plants in the nursery: To achieve this, the following measures are recommended.\\n\\n- Discourage use of cultivars KEN 16/3, K 145, TRI 2024, TRI 2142, TRI 3020, TRI 4067, TRI 3073, TRI 3072 for the drier areas where Phomopsis canker is a problem.\\n- Strictly adhere to standard planting materials.\\n\\nNote: Cultivar response is not prominent in collar canker and dieback caused by F. solani.\\n# (b) Field Practices\\n\\n# Land Selection\\n\\nAvoid planting in unsuitable lands in steep and rocky areas, in areas with underlying slab rock, ravines and in areas with poor drainage.\\n\\n# During Rehabilitation\\n\\nExamine the grass during the drought and mark out the areas where the grass is not growing satisfactorily, particularly in patches. Determine whether such poor growth is due to underlying slab rock or poor soil by digging a pit. Having determined the cause of the poor growth of grass, either ameliorate it or diversify into grass.\\n\\n# During Field Planting\\n\\nIt is important to prepare correct-size planting holes and follow up by correct planting, to encourage a well distributed root system:\\n\\n- Thatch the clearing with loppings of Mana, Guatemala or Eragrostis curvula.\\n- Avoid deep planting and accumulation of soil at base after planting.\\n\\n# Post-planting Operations\\n\\nApply fertilizer correctly, as recommended (see Advisory Circular SP 2). Protect the plants against blister blight until maturity: Entry of Phomopsis can take place through wounds caused by stem infections due to blister blight. If any cankers are noticed, remove the branch just below the canker as soon as they are noticed. Thatch all new clearings adequately.\\n\\n# 3.2 Chemical Methods\\n\\nAs infection is always sporadic, prophylactic treatment of all plants in a clearing is not advocated to prevent possible infection on a small number of plants. However; it has been observed that the fields, which receive adequate controlling in blister blight; by way of fungicides, particularly the systemic ones, to record less incidence of collar canker.\\n\\nIntervals based on severity (2-4 application is required, see refer Advisory Circular PU2): Drench the canker infected bushes with a recommended systemic fungicide at 0.05% at 2-4 weeks.\\n\\nPlants showing general yellowing of the foliage and dieback to be uprooted and burnt in situ.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved: No part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, including photocopying, recording, scanning or information storage and retrieval system without the prior written permission from the Director; Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='4b984fb7-d65a-486e-90d4-4ce4f690016f', embedding=None, metadata={'filename': 'Advisory_Circular_DM7e_2024.md', 'extension': '.md', 'url': 'https://www.tri.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Advisory_Circular_DM7e_2024.pdf', 'title': 'MANAGEMENT OF HORSE-HAIR BLIGHT IN TEA', 'issue_date': Timestamp('2024-02-01 00:00:00')}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.DM 4 tn 925JHLVYN\\n\\nIssued in: February 2024\\n\\nSerial No: 10/24\\n\\n# MANAGEMENT OF HORSE-HAIR BLIGHT IN TEA\\n\\n(This Advisory Circular cancels Guideline 1/03 issued in May 2003)\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nHorse-hair Blight is so named because the cord of mycelium (rhizomorph); which is blackish, round and rather stout;, has a striking resemblance to the black horse hair. Marasmius crinis-equi which is an epiphyte (growing on the bush without deriving its nourishment from the living tissues) seen to be growing on the branches and leaves of the tea bush. It is often mistaken for a parasite because of the dead leaves and twigs being attached to the hair-like chords. Besides tea, it has been recorded on nutmeg, rubber and other jungle shrubs.\\n\\n# 2. Symptoms\\n\\nHorse-hair Blight originates either from the main stem or any of the branches and the fungal strands grow upwards, with the help of small brown pads of hyphal aggregates, crisscrossing the entire bush: netting, in which all the debris and falling leaves are entrapped. The fungus usually obtains its nourishment from the dead outer bark of the older tea stems as well as from the decaying material within its entangle. This results in a matrix of debris. The problem assumes greater dimensions towards the latter stages of the pruning cycle, giving the bush a very unhygienic appearance. Heavily affected bushes would generally appear to be unthrifty.\\n\\n# 3. Occurrence and Spread\\n\\nThis problem is normally more prevalent in tea fields situated below 600 m elevation, possibly due to temperature and humidity being relatively high, and hence it is considered a low-country problem: Low lying riverbed-associated flat terrains are more conducive to this problem, even though it is also commonly seen in shady and damp upper slopes of fields. Though this was considered an insignificant problem in the past; mainly affecting debilitated tea, increased incidences and intensities have been reported in recent times probably due to expansion of tea planting into more marginal conditions. The lack of attention to details, like adequate post-prune bush sanitation, may have permitted the few strands first noticeable to multiply to heavy proportions over subsequent cycles. The remnants left behind at pruning would lead to a greater tangle of mycelial threads by the end of the current cycle capable of collecting more debris and falling leaves. Since the fungus is non-parasitic, no direct damage is done to the growing bush. However; it can cause a heavy leaf fall and physical hindrance to operations such as plucking and pruning (more so with mechanical pruning), the severity varying in proportion to the undisturbed age of the tangle.\\n\\n# 4. Remedial Measures\\n\\nMaintenance of bush sanitation is of paramount importance. Cleaning of bush frames should commence at first prune; and any black mycelial threads present should be removed physically. Such bush sanitation, at pruning, should be practiced on all new clearings in areas below 600 m. Burying the prunings and mycelial threads of the fungus:\\n# Spraying of Hydrated Lime\\n\\nSpraying of hydrated lime on to tea bush frames should be considered mandatory after each prune. About 1,000 L of this solution would be required to cover ha of tea (Please refer Advisory Circular PU2).\\n\\n# Improving Soil Conditions\\n\\nImproving soil conditions by the addition of organic matter combined with periodic forking is also an indispensable operation:\\n\\nPoorly drained (alluvial) soils should be provided with better drainage and aeration.\\n\\nDuring monsoon periods, adequate sunlight and ambient aeration should be provided by adopting proper shade management practices:\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Objectives\\n\\nThe objectives of pruning tea are to:\\n\\n- maintain a convenient height of the plucking table for easy harvesting,\\n- stimulate vegetative shoot growth for sustaining productivity,\\n- remove old, decayed, pest-infested and diseased branches for maintaining a healthy frame,\\n- effectively utilize the land area, and ensure economic viability of plantations.\\n\\n# 2. Categorization of fields\\n\\nIn order to embark on a balanced and successful pruning programme, it is necessary to categorize tea fields according to their potential yield. This will reduce the risk of crop losses and annual fluctuations:\\n\\nCategorization of fields should be updated periodically, taking into consideration the new clearings under capital, coming into bearing under revenue. Please refer Advisory Circular No. LU2 on Field categorization in tea lands for details.\\n\\n# 3. Methods of pruning\\n\\nPruning should be done with a sharp knife and the cut preferably, be made slanted towards the centre of the bush. There are four major styles of pruning, as outlined below viz. clean, rim lung, cut-across and rejuvenation pruning. Although rim lung pruning is the most suitable method, other styles also can be adopted under special circumstances as given below.\\n\\n# 3.1 Clean Pruning\\n\\nThis is a hard pruning system by which all the branches are cut low at a height of 25-40 cm (10-16\"). Clean pruning usually results in late or poor recovery due to the absence of foliage and inadequate starch reserves to support bud break and subsequent growth of shoots.\\n\\nHowever, clean pruning may be adopted at high elevations, provided the soil and weather conditions are conducive for growth and adequate starch reserves are available in the tea bush for better recovery after pruning.\\n# 3.2 Rim lung pruning\\n\\nIn rim lung pruning, about 3 to 4 healthy branches are left at the periphery of the bush at the time of pruning. These lung branches should have in all about 200 to 300 leaves per bush to enable early recovery. The recommended height of pruning is 40-55 cm (16-22\").\\n\\n# 3.3 Cut-across pruning\\n\\nIn cut-across pruning, the top of the bush is cut level at a height of about 55-70 cm (22-28\"). In this type of pruning, no cleaning up of old debilitated branches is possible and hence it can lead to poor frame development. Thereafter, the bushes will remain dormant for a prolonged period. Old, debilitated or marginal tea fields that are earmarked for uprooting or diversification can be given a cut-across pruning. With cut-across pruning, it is possible to obtain an early crop.\\n\\n# 3.4 Rejuvenation Pruning\\n\\nRejuvenation pruning is a type of hard pruning carried out when the foundation frame of bushes reaches an unproductive stage. The height of pruning can vary depending on the status of the frame. Please refer to the \\'Advisory Circular\\' No. HP4 on rejuvenation pruning for details.\\n\\n# 3.5 Skiffing\\n\\nSkiffing is a slashing or leveling operation which smoothens the plucking surface and reduces its height by a few centimetres. It can be used to delay a rush crop or to extend the pruning cycle, if the need arises.\\n\\n# 4. Length of pruning cycle\\n\\nThe lengths of pruning cycle recommended for different tea growing regions are:\\n\\n|Region|Seedling|VP|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Low country|2 years|3 years|\\n|Mid-country (wet zone)|3 - 4 years|4 - 5 years|\\n|Mid-country (Intermediate zone) or Uva|3 - 4 years|4 - 5 years|\\n|Up country|3 - 4 years|4 - 5 years|\\n\\n# 5. Time of pruning\\n\\nPruning in the Up country, Mid-country (wet zone) and Low country regions could be done during April to June, after a few showers from the south-west monsoon and when there is adequate soil moisture. For some reason, if pruning cannot be done or completed during this season, those fields could be pruned during September to October. However, high yielding fields should be pruned during the south-west monsoon. Some areas in the low country (Balangoda, Rakwana).\\n# Pruning Guidelines for High-Yielding Tea Fields\\n\\nHigh-yielding tea fields should be pruned during September to October with the onset of rains. In the Uva regions, high-yielding tea fields should be pruned during October to January which is an assured season of rain in this area. The remaining fields earmarked for pruning in the same region could be pruned during March to April. Pruning of a field should be completed within the shortest period of time (within about 7 days). This is to facilitate complete post pruning practices in time.\\n\\nTea fields should not be pruned immediately after harvesting the rush crop and following prolonged drought. These fields should be rested at least for about 6 weeks. The period could be extended in the case of pruning of debilitated bushes. This is extremely necessary for building up of carbohydrate reserves for early and better recovery after pruning. In order to identify fields to be rested before pruning, a simple iodine test on roots can be done about 2-3 months before pruning.\\n\\n# 6. Dry Weather Pruning\\n\\nPruning into dry weather is not recommended, because it may cause sun scorch on branches leading to wood rot and frame debilitation. Scorching also reduces the number of new shoots. Dry weather pruning as a measure of controlling blister blight is also not recommended.\\n\\n# 7. Bush Sanitation\\n\\nThis involves the removal and shaving off weak, diseased, dead or pest-infested stems and branches to renovate the bush frame. Bush renovation should be undertaken from the 1st pruning onwards. The individual branches with extensive die-back, wood rot, canker and termite damage could be pruned low while maintaining a uniform height of prune. It is preferable to apply a recommended wound dressing on the prune cuts and shaved off wounds. Pruned branches can be protected from sun scorch by placing some of the prunings over the bush for about 3 days immediately after pruning.\\n\\n# 8. Mossing and Ferning\\n\\nMoss and fern on the frames should be cleaned manually or chemically using lime, soon after pruning and well before the commencement of bud-break. Hydrated lime can be sprayed on the frames at the rate of 125 kg dissolved in 1250 L of water per ha.\\n# 9. Burying of prunings\\n\\nIn order to enhance soil fertility, pruned branches should be retained in the field as mulch or buried in shallow trenches in the alternate inter-rows of flat or undulating tea lands. Lopped branches of shade trees cut into pieces may also be incorporated.\\n\\n# 10. Removal of lung branches\\n\\nThe lungs should be removed selectively depending on the stage of recovery of individual bushes. This should to be started when the majority of new shoots have produced 3-4 fully opened leaves. Removal of lungs too early or too late should be avoided.\\n\\n# 11. Tipping height\\n\\nShoots should be tipped leaving 4 to 6 leaves above the prune cut, depending on the pruning height. Early tipping or plucking-in should be avoided, because it will retard thickening of branches which leads to poor frame development. Suspend application of fertilizers 2-3 months prior to pruning. Resume application of fertilizers 2-3 months after pruning: This could be done at the time of tipping. Early application of fertilizer before tipping can cause leaf-scorch. Dolomitic limestone should be applied based on soil pH, preferably a few weeks before pruning. Please refer Advisory Circular No. SP3 on Fertilizer recommendations for mature tea for details.\\n\\n# 12. Fertilizer and dolomitic limestone application\\n\\nSuspend application of fertilizers 2-3 months prior to pruning. Resume application of fertilizers 2-3 months after pruning. This could be done at the time of tipping. Early application of fertilizer before tipping can cause leaf-scorch. Dolomitic limestone should be applied based on soil pH, preferably a few weeks before pruning. Please refer Advisory Circular No. SP3 on Fertilizer recommendations for mature tea for details.\\n\\n# 13. Envelope forking\\n\\nEnvelope forking is beneficial for soil aeration and root growth. It could be done at the time of tipping, once in a cycle at high and mid-elevations, and once in two cycles at low elevations.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle.\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Hence, the profitability of tea plantations depends to a large extent on the harvesting policies. Well-balanced plucking policy enhances the yield and optimises the labour use without affecting the quality of made tea.\\n\\n# Shoot growth and shoot generations\\n\\nThe production and storing of food materials take place in all growing shoots and growth of a bush depends on such food materials. Plucking removes a greater part of shoots that are in the process of production. The degree of removal of growing shoots can affect the growth and yield of a tea bush. In order to optimise the shoot growth, it is very essential to understand the functions or the importance of different growing stages of a tea shoot:\\n\\n- Bud\\n- Normal Leaves\\n- Fish Leaf\\n- Scale Leaves\\n- Janam Leaf\\n- Mother Leaf\\n\\nTea Shoot\\n# Growth of shoots\\n\\nAfter plucking, shoot growth starts from the axillary buds just below the point of plucking. There is potential for a number of axillary buds to commence growth after apical growth is interrupted by plucking. But the first axillary bud immediately below the plucking point usually grows first.\\n\\nInitially, two small appendages known as scale leaves, which cover the bud, open. They generally fall off a few days after opening out. Then another one or two medium sized, unserrated, blunt leaves are unfolded above these scale leaves. The smaller one immediately above the scale leaves is termed janam leaf and the other one is called the fish leaf. Then the bud starts to produce normal leaves which are commonly included in the harvest.\\n\\nAfter unfurling 4-5 leaves, the terminal bud becomes inactive and passes through a dormant (resting) period known as banjhi or wangi. The growth pattern having alternate active and dormant growing phases is termed as periodicity of growth.\\n\\nInitiation of the axillary bud growth is rather slow. It enters into a fast growing period after unfurling the janam/fish leaf. This is generally known as the linear phase of growth, reaching the harvestable size; i.e., with 2-3 flush leaves. Shoot weight approximately doubles at the opening of each extra leaf on a shoot.\\n\\n# Shoot generations\\n\\nThere are a number of shoots of different growth stages in a tea bush: i.e., growing buds, bud and scale leaves; bud and fish leaf; etc. A group of shoots of the same growth stage or age is called a generation. The generations are formed as a result of variation in shoot growth and frequent harvesting. Continuous plucking is possible as there are a large number of shoots belonging to different generations in a tea bush. The number of generations usually increases with shortening of the plucking round. Increase in shoot generations helps to increase the shoot population density, which is the major yield component.\\n\\nGrowing buds and immature shoots (arimbus) on a plucking table are considered major sites for storing carbohydrates (sink) produced by mature leaves (source) essential to ensure that the immature shoots are left on the bush after plucking.\\n# Leaf standard (Plucking standard)\\n\\nThis refers to the composition of standard flush leaf of the harvested crop.\\n\\nStandard (acceptable) flush leaf means:\\n\\n- Shoots with two tender leaves & bud\\n- Immature dormant shoots\\n- Shoots with three tender leaves & bud\\n\\nImmature shoots and coarse leaf are unacceptable.\\n\\n# Percentage of Standard Lush Leaf Standard\\n\\n|Fine Plucking|More than 75%|\\n|---|---|\\n| |60-75%|\\n|Coarse Plucking| |\\n|Medium Plucking| |\\n| |Less than 60%|\\n\\nPlucking coarse leaves will lead to drop in the quality of made tea.\\n\\n# Plucking style (Severity of plucking)\\n\\nThis refers to the point at which a shoot is plucked. The appropriate plucking style should be selected depending on the prevailing weather pattern, bush vigour and labour availability.\\n\\nA well-planned plucking policy with a combination of light and hard plucking during different seasons, by maintaining a good canopy depth, should be carried out.\\n\\n# Severity of plucking\\n\\n|Plucking Style|Point of Plucking|Type of leaves left on the bush|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Light Plucking or Single leaf plucking or Mother leaf plucking|Just above the first mature leaf|One mature leaf; fish leaf & scale leaves|\\n|Hard Plucking or Fish leaf plucking|Just above the fish leaf|Fish leaf & scale leaves|\\n# Plucking Round\\n\\n# Frequency of Plucking\\n\\nPlucking round is the number of days between successive plucking. An ideal plucking round is the number of days taken between successive openings of leaves on a shoot. This period is called leaf period or phyllochron.\\n\\nPlucking rounds become shorter during wet weather while it is extended during dry weather. Therefore, the plucking rounds should also be determined accordingly. Maintaining a proper plucking round that matches the rate of shoot growth helps to increase the yield and to minimize a drop in the quality of made tea.\\n\\nHaphazard extended plucking rounds may not only lower the made tea quality, but also reduce the yield. Plucking rounds and the plucking standards are independent factors. Extended rounds may influence the plucking standards due to high percentage of over-mature shoots.\\n\\n# Plucking and Vigour of the Bush\\n\\nThe tea leaf attains the highest photosynthetic activity when they reach half their final size. It remains at the maximum for about 6 months from full expansion. Usually, the life span of a tea leaf is about 18 months. This shows that the older leaves do not contribute to the production because production plucking to a mother leaf for about 6 months per year is required.\\n\\nTherefore, addition of new foliage on the canopy by continuous mother leaf plucking leads to the unnecessary rise in the plucking table. Maintenance of a thick canopy (more than 25 cm) is not required, as leaves at the bottom layers of the canopy do not receive sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis. Adoption of mother leaf plucking is necessary to build up adequate leaf canopy.\\n\\nDepth of maintenance foliage is less in young tea and in pruned tea. Hence, fish leaf plucking could be done during the cropping months, while mother leaf plucking during the balance periods is recommended. Hard plucking will give a higher yield initially, but continuous hard plucking will result in debilitation of the bush and an increase in the formation of feet condition.\\n\\nContinuous hard plucking or light plucking systems will bring about low productivity of the bush. It is therefore important to adopt mixture depending on the prevailing weather condition in the area, the age from pruning and bringing into bearing practices.\\n\\n# Mechanical Harvesting\\n\\nMechanical harvesting should be sought if the hand plucking is impractical due to the scarcity of labour. Under such conditions, TRI Selective Tea Harvester could be used.\\n# Other important aspects of plucking\\n\\n1. Plucking table should be even and it should follow the slope of the land. This should be initiated from the time of pruning/tipping and continued with the bush creep.\\n2. Removal of banji and crows-feet should be a routine practice.\\n3. Immature shoots (armbus) must be left unplucked to be taken at the next round as heavier units.\\n4. Coarse leaves and stalks should be removed in the field to maintain a better leaf standard and a plucking table.\\n5. Shoots on side branches and hollows on the plucking table should be left unplucked until they cover the open spaces.\\n6. Pluckers should be instructed not to ram the flush into their baskets.\\n7. Pluckers should be instructed not to retain an excessive number of plucked shoots in their hands.\\n8. Plucking on the rested bushes and on the 'lungs' of pruned bushes should be avoided.\\n9. Transporting should be minimized: shoots possible damages to plucked at the point of weighing, bulking and.\\n10. Education of pluckers and careful supervision on plucking will ensure the quality of made tea.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

The soil surface to harvest crop as well as to perform other cultural operations. This treading creates run-off of most of the rain falling on the surface. The entry of air through the surface pores is also restricted thereby, causing a deficit of oxygen that is most necessary for vigorous root growth. When infiltration of rainwater is low and run-off is high, the fertilizer applied will be washed away with the run-off water, thus causing wastage of costly fertilizer.\\n\\n# 2. Method of Soil Cultivation\\n\\nTo break compaction and aerate the soil, the type of soil cultivation recommended is termed \"forking\". The objective of forking is to ensure deep cultivation of soil in a mild degree. Forking could be carried out in the inter-row spaces both in VP and Seedling tea. In the case of seedling fields which is planted up and down the slope, forking could be carried out in a staggered manner.\\n\\nWhile forking, the soil is opened up, at the center of the inter-row space, without turning over the clod and with minimum of disturbance to the feeder roots. Deep forking is undertaken with a garden fork having 3-4 tines, 38-45 cm long, which is forced into the ground at a nearly vertical angle up to depth of 38-45 cm. The handle of the fork is pocket behind the tines. The fork is then withdrawn when the operation is called \"plain forking\". Well decomposed tea waste, manure, loppings and such other materials (compost, or else the ground litter, green materials) are pushed into the pocket created, in which case it is called \"envelope forking\". This operation is repeated at intervals of about 22-30 cm apart.\\n\\n# 3. Forking in Relation to Weather\\n\\nForking during prolonged dry weather should be avoided. When forking is carried out in such dry periods, the soil surface is exposed to wind and sun resulting in increased evaporation of soil water. It is also advisable to avoid forking during heavy rains, as soils of unstable crumb structure tend to puddle very readily.\\n# 4. Frequency and Time of Forking\\n\\n# 4.1 Frequency of Forking\\n\\nIt is recommended that forking be carried out only in mid-country, and once known to be clayey and compacted, the flexibility to fork once a cycle may be allowed.\\n\\n# 4.2 Time of Forking\\n\\nThough forking is normally done after pruning, the best time to undertake forking is when there is sufficient new foliage on the bush and adequate soil moisture, which would be around tipping time. Forking could also be spread over two intervals, when alternate rows are forked each time. The first round may be undertaken as described above, while the second round may be given mid-cycle, but at the latter time there would be insufficient space between two rows for comfortable worker movement.\\n\\n# 5. Economics of Forking\\n\\nThe benefits of improving soil physical properties and water percolation into the soil through forking cannot always be calculated in physical terms, but it could be assumed to reflect in the yield. Recent research indicated that, over a 4-year cycle, forking can give a net incremental yield of about 20%, compared to the control. This analysis, whilst indicating the profitability of the operation of forking, should not be taken out of context and generalized. Research data is applicable only to the specific set of conditions (slope, soil, rainfall, and microclimate) operating in a given field yet could be taken to serve as an indicator of the economic advantages that could accrue through forking.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Sections of the ageing old tea fields become weakened to a state of being no longer able to withstand the rigours of normal cultivation and the adverse impacts of the environment, including the changes of the weather as well as that of the attack by pests and diseases. Such ill effects lead to:\\n\\n1. Poor or non-recovery from prune and eventual death of bushes, with resulting vacancies\\n2. An increase in the existence of economically non-viable \"passenger\" tea bushes\\n3. Increased susceptibility to pests and diseases affecting the frame and roots\\n\\n# Objectives\\n\\nThe overall rejuvenation programme aims at arresting the decline outlined above and to restore, at least in part, the vigour of the afflicted sections of the field by rejuvenation pruning as well as by infilling, to help bring back the field to a state of being economically viable. The indiscriminate uprooting of deep-rooted old seedling tea bushes for purposes of large scale replanting leads to enormous amounts of soil disturbance and losses, especially on sloping terrain. In order to avert such disturbances and losses on such sloping terrain, the fields in these locations could possibly be taken themselves to rejuvenation pruning and consolidation by infilling.\\n\\n# Fields with potential for rejuvenation\\n\\nFields that are marginal and non-retrievable to a state of economic viability as well as fields that are earmarked for replanting within the next ten years, should be left out. The selection criteria for the remaining fields are based on the following:\\n# 11.\\n\\nThere should not be a widespread incidence of root disease such as Poria or root pests such as heavy incidence of plant parasitic nematodes or the up-country live-wood tea termites.\\n\\n# 2.2.\\n\\nThe collar/base of the bushes to be renovated should not be debilitated.\\n\\n# 33.\\n\\nAt least 50% of the stand should be taken themselves to rejuvenation pruning.\\n\\n# 4.4.\\n\\nThere should be a good depth of soil with the absence of surface gravel or rocks and boulders.\\n\\n# Preparation of the selected field\\n\\n# 11.\\n\\nThe field should be fully rested for a period not less than six months.\\n\\n# 22.\\n\\nA minimum of two fertilizer applications should be given during the rest phase bush by providing the equivalent of 60 kg N per ha per application from the recommended mixture.\\n\\n# 3\\n\\nIt is preferable to give a quantity of about 6 to 8 metric tons of well decomposed compost (a mixture of well decomposed refuse tea and any other suitable green matter) per hectare.\\n\\n# 4\\n\\nThe rejuvenation pruning should be carried out with the onset of the wet weather (Western Sector - S.W. monsoon and Eastern Sector - N.E. monsoon). The pruned litter (brushwood) should be immediately buried in shallow trenches (20 to 30 cm depth), cut in alternate contour rows.\\n\\n# 5\\n\\nThe cut surfaces and shaved off wounds on the stumps should be painted over with a recommended wound-dressing: Please refer Advisory Circular Nos. PU2 and PU4 and on chemical control of diseases and chemical control of insect, mite and nematode pests respectively.\\n\\n# 6\\n\\nDolomitic limestone is recommended to be applied at the rate of about 1 to 2.5 metric tons/ha (depending on soil acidity) prior to pruning (please refer Advisory Circular No. SP 3 on Fertilizer recommendations for mature tea).\\n\\n# 7\\n\\nIn areas prone to Blister Blight leaf disease, special care should be taken to prevent the outbreaks on the recovering shoots, by strictly adhering to the recommendations given in Advisory Circulars No. DM 1 and PU 2 on protection of tea from blister blight and Chemical control of diseases respectively.\\n# 88.\\n\\nDuring recovery of the pruned field, a concerted infilling programme needs to be carried out with specifically grown 18-month-old nursery plants of the appropriate cultivars raised in jumbo polythene sleeves.\\n\\n# 9\\n\\nInfilling should commence soon after pruning, within the monsoon that immediately follows the prune. Infilling of casualties may continue during the following monsoon as well. The plants for infilling should be raised well on time by proper programming. The infilling programme of the rejuvenated field should aim at a target bush population of at least 8000 bushes per ha.\\n\\n# 10.10.\\n\\nTipping should be done at a height of about 60 cm (24 inches) from ground level with the main objective of developing thick and healthy pruning frames.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Land can be classified according to its agricultural suitability. Performance limitations of land intended for tea-growing can be determined by its physical, chemical and biological features.\\n\\nLand classification can simplify management and decision-making on new planting, replanting, infilling, diversification and conservation of tea lands. It also helps to assess the long-term production trends and investment needs for enhanced productivity.\\n\\nThere are many factors that determine land suitability for tea. The most important factors are climate, slope, soil depth, surface rockiness and gravel content. Certain of these factors could be limiting factors. A simplified land suitability classification for tea can be based on limitations imposed by these factors and their interactions (Tables 1a and 1b):\\n\\n|Climate (agro-ecological region)|Limiting Factor|Degree of Limitation|Slope (%)|Soil Depth (cm)|Surface Rockiness (%)|Gravel (Vol % in 50cm)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Regions above 900 m elevation|WU 23 IU 23|None|0 - 25|&gt;90|0 - 10|0 - 10|\\n| |IU1|Moderate|25 - 70|70 - 90|10 - 20|10 - 50|\\n| |All other up country regions|Severe|&gt;70|&lt;70|&gt;20|&gt;50|\\n|Regions between 300 - 900 m elevation|WM 3|None|0 - 25|&gt;90|0 - 10|0 - 10|\\n| |WM 2 & IM 2|Moderate|25 - 55|70 - 90|10 - 20|10 - 50|\\n| |All other mid country regions|Severe|&gt;55|&lt;70|&gt;20|&gt;50|\\n|Regions below 300 m elevation|WL 2|None|0 - 25|790|0 - 10|0 - 10|\\n| |All other low country regions|Moderate|25 - 70|70 - 90|10 - 20|10 - 50|\\n| | |Severe|770|&lt;70|&gt;20|&gt;50|\\n# Table 1b.

Introduction\\n\\nAn estate comprises of numerous fields, often separated from each other by natural boundaries such as ravines and footpaths or man-made boundaries such as wind belts and fences. A given field is generally planted in one year and in an extent that can be handled by one gang of pluckers. Some fields would be high yielding while others may not be, and hence the contribution of each field to total estate crop can vary. Records of crop harvested, workers utilized, fertilizer applied, and cultural operations are maintained individually for each field. This information could be advantageously exploited for planning a development program for the estate as a whole by relating inputs to field productivity.\\n\\n# 2. Basis of Categorization\\n\\nCategorization is based on the performance of each field, which would generally be dependent on topography, microclimate, soil fertility, any pest and disease incidence, and any other constraints that may prevail. As crop harvested is the most reliable indicator of productivity (yield per unit area), it can be utilized to categorize them. In order to even out variations that may exist (weather, inputs, worker efficiency etc.) over successive years, field categorization should be based on the average yield achieved over the past 2-3 pruning cycles. The cycle lengths in all fields on an estate should, as far as possible, be constant. Generally, tea fields on each plantation can be categorized into three equal categories based on their average annual yields over the past 2-3 pruning cycles.\\n\\n# 3. Computation of Yield\\n\\nIn order to arrive at a system of categorization, the following steps are necessary:\\n\\n# 3.1. Obtain yield records\\n\\nObtain yield records for the last 2 or 3 completed pruning cycles from the yield book. The first year of the cycle refers to the first 12 months since pruning, the second year from the 13th to the 24th month and so on.\\n\\n# 3.2. Calculate the mean yield\\n\\nCalculate the mean yield per unit area per year (YPH) of each pruning cycle as follows:\\n\\n|Mean cycle yield (kg/ha/year)|=|Total production over the full cycle|X|12|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total Number of Months in the cycle| | | | |\\n# 3.3. Construct a table with 5 columns as follows;\\n\\n|Name of Estate|Date|CATEGORIZATION OF FIELDS|YPH of field(1)|Field No.(2)|Extent(3) (ha)|Cumulative(4)|Remarks(5)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Extent|(Age of field etc)| | | | | |\\n\\n# 3.4.\\n\\nTo divide the estate into three categories, see which entry in column 4 comes closest to 1/3rd the estate extent and draw a horizontal line entry across the table. All fields above this line will fall into \"A\" Category: Similarly, separate out \"B\" and \"C\" categories by drawing a horizontal line across the table below the entry where the entry in column 4 is closest to 2/3rd of the total extent.\\n\\n# 3.5\\n\\nAfter categorizing the fields as above, it is necessary to undertake a thorough study of each field and shift any field, either up or down, based on whether they have undergone any significant changes which merit a shift (including extreme weather periods, amalgamation of fields, crop etc).\\n\\n# 3.6\\n\\nField categorization may also be undertaken for each division of the estate elevation:\\n\\nWhere there is a significant proportion of VP tea, then VP tea and old seedling could be advantageously categorized separately, as their cycle lengths would be invariably different from each other.\\n\\n# 4. Features of the different categories\\n\\n4.1 \"A\" Category Fields: These would be the best one-third of the fields on the given plantation, and would have best stand of tea. Most of the VP tea will be included in this category based on the assumption that their potential yield is high: For some years to come, the plantation has to depend on this category of tea as the bulk of the crop is obtained from these fields. All the inputs should be given without restrictions. The vacancies must be infilled after each prune, to maintain such tea in good condition: Such lands will not be replanted for a long time to come. Replanting/in filling could commence in the lowest yielding fields in this category.\\n\\n# 4.2 \"B\" Category Fields:\\n\\nThe yield would be relatively poorer than \"A\" category, provided there are no soil limitations.\\n# 4.3 \"C\" Category Fields\\n\\nThese fields would consist of the poorest one-third of the poor: Where there are no major limitations, this category could be replanted/infilled: Other fields where lands are steep and soils are eroded, can be diversified away from tea:\\n\\n# 5. Advantages of Categorization\\n\\nThe main benefit is the prioritization of funds into productive fields, particularly when funds are limited, to obtain maximum returns from limited resources. When fertilizer is in short supply, or curtailment of expenditure is necessitated due to budgetary constraints, we could optimize inputs in better fields to attain maximum benefits, and restrict them to the restriction of inputs, priorities could also be more clearly laid down for efficient and relatively poor fields rather than impose a standard cut all round: In a manner similar to cost-effective worker utilization for various cultural operations.\\n\\nCategorization is most useful in maintaining the estate production uniformly from one year to other: In order to achieve this objective, it is essential to prune equal extents in cycle, one would prune a fourth of each category: For replanting, a long term program could be prepared to replace the tea in fields at the \"C\" category, where there are no major limitations. A critical examination must be undertaken on each selected field to determine the cause for low yields. Replanting should be considered only if soil conditions are suitable, without much erosion.\\n\\nIt is only natural that there are deaths in tea fields from time to time and if not replaced, a regular program of infilling, then productivity of such fields will decline steadily: Infilling should commence with the \"A\" category fields, consisting of all VP tea and the best seedling tea, and thereafter the better \"B\" category fields. The poorer \"B\" category fields as soil conditions may be too poor for good growth of infills. Infilling generally would not be desirable in lower \"C\" category fields.\\n\\n# 6. Conclusion\\n\\nCategorization is a dynamic system as it depends on the development of fields relative to one another in a given estate. When a replanted field comes into bearing; it gets into the \"A\" category, thereby pushing the lowest \"A\" category field into \"B\" category and the lowest \"B\" category field into \"C\" category: So, some of the marginal tea lands low down in instances would alter the category of some fields, indicating that categorization is not a once-and-for-all exercise and has to be reviewed/revised periodically.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n# COPY RIGHT\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

This is sometimes referred to as bush formation. To achieve this goal, the plants should be subjected to minimum stress operation which leads to early plucking; retards weed growth and also facilitates soil conservation. As a result of the formation of an early ground cover, a successful bringing into bearing easily succumb to drought, if the root growth of young plants can be adversely affected and must, however, be noted that they are brought into bearing very early.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThere are two methods of bringing young tea into bearing: They are cut-across and bending and pegging. The practice of bending and pegging is discouraged for reasons of frame debilitation arising from sun scorch; canker and woad rot. The more suitable method of bringing young tea into bearing is cut-across, and this is also known as centering.\\n\\n# Cut-across (Centering)\\n\\nPlants are allowed to be well established in the field and grow as healthy plants with strong leader and lateral branches for a period of 9-12 months, branching habit of the clone, leaving as many side branches as possible. The main stem is cut at a height of 20-25 cm from ground level, depending on the branching habit of the clone. After a lapse of about 4-6 months, a second cut is given at a height of 35-40 cm across all branches. Once the plant is adequately regenerated, shoots are tipped at a height of 45-50 cm and the mini bush is brought into light plucking. A sharp knife or a secateur can be used for these operations. While centering is done, peripheral branches or horizontally growing side shoots should not be removed so that an early ground cover is established. Dry periods should be avoided for centering to minimize environmental stress on bud break and subsequent growth of shoots.\\n# The Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\n# Talawakelle\\n\\n\\n# \\nAll rights reserved.

Its damage to cultivated crops has become frequent in the recent past and tea is no exception. Most of the tea growing regions in Sri Lanka receive rains from both north-east and south-west monsoons. However, tea plantations are adversely affected by moisture stress conditions due to uneven distribution of rainfall within the year. The main dry period in most of the tea growing regions extends from early January to about late March. However, those areas which receive mainly the north-east monsoon rains, viz. Uva and some parts of the Low and Mid country, have the rain dry period generally extending from late June to about early September.\\n\\nDuring these dry months, considerable damage can be caused to both young and mature tea, with extensive casualties being observed in young clonal tea during their first and the second year after planting. In order to minimize such damage and ensure early recovery, the following precautionary measures need to be adopted prior to, and following, a drought. The drought effects differ with the growth stage of tea, that is whether it is young tea (before first pruning) or mature tea (after first pruning). Hence drought mitigation measures also should vary according to the stage of growth of the tea.\\n\\n# 1. New clearings tea before the first proper prune\\n\\n# 1.1 Measures to be adopted before and during drought\\n\\n# 1.1.1 Mulching\\n\\nThe inter-rows of new clearings should be thatched with Guatemala or Mana grass well before the monsoon tails off. For this purpose, about 37.5 metric tons per hectare (15 tons per acre) fresh material would be required. This could be obtained from single lopping from one hectare of well-tended grass clearing. Partially decomposed waste materials such as sawdust, paddy husk and refuse tea can be used (at the rate of 15-20 tons/ha) for mulching. They can be applied as a layer 1\" - 2\" thick, leaving about 6\" - 8\" from the base of the tea plants. If paddy husk or sawdust are used, they should be mixed or sprayed with urea at the rate of 2-3 kg per 100 kg of material. Mulching should be repeated 2 - 3 times a year depending on the rate of decomposition of the material used.\\n\\n# 1.1.2 Weed control\\n\\nNew clearings should be kept free of weeds during drought. Hence, weeding program should be completed before the onset of the drought. If weeds are present during the drought, they can be slashed down to minimize competition for soil moisture. As plants are under moisture stress, spraying of any herbicide during drought is not recommended.\\n\\n# 1.1.3 Spraying of Sulphate of potash (SOP) or Muriate of potash (MOP) and Kaolin\\n\\nIn order to reduce transpiration by the leaves, 2% SOP or 2% MOP can be sprayed (at the rate of 2 kg/ha in 100 L of water during 1st year; 4 kg/ha in 200 L of water during 2nd year and 8 kg/ha in 400 L of water during 3rd year) using a knapsack sprayer. Spraying should commence at least a month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending on the severity of drought. Urea can also be mixed (2 kg/ha) with SOP or MOP to enhance K.\\n# 1.1 Management Practices During Drought\\n\\n# 1.1.1 Absorption\\n\\nIn plucking fields, spraying should be done immediately after harvesting of flush to ensure proper deposition of spray droplets on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should be avoided since the drip would cause leaf scorch.\\n\\nSpraying of Kaolin (5 - 10 kg of Kaolin in 100 L of water) on to the leaves of young tea plants reduces heat and water loss by transpiration. Spraying should be done soon after drought sets in.\\n\\n# 1.1.4 Irrigation\\n\\nIf water is available, irrigate first year plants at 4 - 7 day intervals with 400 - 500 ml plant application. The volume should be doubled for the second year plants irrigating them at 7 - 10 day intervals.\\n\\n# 1.1.5 Skiffing\\n\\nIf the drought is prolonged and the plants remain wilted in the morning hours, young tea in their second to fourth year from planting can be partially defoliated by giving a light skiff to remove the top most 2\" - 3\" of foliage.\\n\\n# 1.1.6 Fertilizer Application\\n\\nFertilizer applications should be avoided during dry weather.\\n\\n# 1.1.7 Green Manure Crops\\n\\nSALT hedge rows and other green manure crops inter-planted with tea should be lopped. Cover-crops should be cut back to ground level before the onset of a drought.\\n\\n# 1.1.8 Pest Control\\n\\nMites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather pests can cause considerable damage to tea plants (Please refer TRI Advisory Circulars on pest control for their management).\\n\\n# 1.2 Measures to be Adopted Following a Drought\\n\\n# 1.2.1 Fertilizer Application\\n\\nYoung tea fertilizers should be applied only after the plants have fully recovered from moisture stress and once the new leaves of defoliated plants are fully opened.\\n\\n# 1.2.2 Bringing into Bearing and Plucking\\n\\nBringing into bearing should be done selectively and only after the plants have fully recovered from moisture stress and the severely affected plants have fully refoliated. Second to fourth year plants in plucking should be harvested only after they have fully recovered from moisture stress and resumed flushing. Light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be resorted to during the first few months. Bushes which are severely affected by drought (defoliated) should be rested until they form a healthy canopy.\\n\\n# 1.2.3 Resupplying\\n\\nIt is necessary to give priority for resupplying the vacancies before undertaking any normal replanting programme scheduled for the year. If drought casualties are found in isolated patches,\\n# Mature Tea\\n\\n# Measures to be adopted before and during drought\\n\\n# 2.1.1 Plucking\\n\\nIt is recommended that light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) be practiced during the drought.\\n\\n# 2.1.2 Spraying of Sulphate of Potash (SOP) or Muriate of Potash (MOP)\\n\\nIn order to mitigate drought damage in mature tea by reducing water losses through transpiration, particularly in drought prone areas, foliar application of SOP or MOP prior to anticipated drought is recommended. A 2% solution of SOP or 2% solution of MOP (8 kg in 400 L of water/ha) to be applied using a knapsack sprayer at fortnight intervals, commencing at least one month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending on the severity of drought. 2% Urea (8 kg/ha) can also be mixed with SOP or MOP to enhance K absorption. Spraying should be done immediately after harvesting to ensure proper deposition on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should be avoided since the drip would cause leaf scorch.\\n\\n# 2.1.3 Skiffing\\n\\nIf bushes show symptoms of wilting in the morning, they can be partially defoliated by giving light skiff to remove the topmost 2\" - 3\" of foliage (below the kolunthu mudichchu).\\n\\n# 2.1.4 Pruning\\n\\nAs a rule, pruning should not be carried out just prior to or during a drought. Dry weather pruning can result in extensive bush debilitation.\\n\\n# 2.1.5 Forking\\n\\nThis operation should be avoided during or just prior to the onset of a drought as it would accelerate loss of soil moisture.\\n\\n# 2.1.6 Weeding\\n\\nFields should be kept free of weeds during a drought. Hence, the weeding programme should be completed before the onset of drought. If weeds are present during drought, they can be slashed down to minimize competition with the tea for soil moisture. Spraying of herbicides during dry weather is not recommended.\\n\\n# 2.1.7 Green manure crops and grasses\\n\\nAll SALT hedge rows and rehabilitation grasses planted in vacant patches in mature tea lands should be lopped prior to a drought.\\n\\n# 2.1.8 Pest control\\n\\nMites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather pests can cause considerable damage to tea bushes (Please refer to TRI Advisory Circulars on pest control series for their management).\\n# 2.2 Measures to be adopted following a drought\\n\\n# 2.2.1 Fertilizer application\\n\\nMature tea bushes affected by drought should be fertilized only after they have fully recovered from moisture stress, i.e. when bushes commence flushing. It is also imperative that the fertilizer application for defoliated bushes is delayed until they have fully refoliated and the first set of new leaves are fully expanded.\\n\\n# 2.2.2 Plucking\\n\\nIn any given field the tea bushes are subjected to varying degrees of drought damage. Light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be adopted until such time that flushing resumes its normal periodicity.\\n\\n# 2.2.3 Pruning\\n\\nPruning of drought affected fields should be delayed until the bushes have fully recovered and produced sufficient foliage. It is also best to rest drought affected fields until adequate root reserves have been accumulated.\\n\\n# 2.2.4 Resupplying vacancies\\n\\nHaving infilled the new clearing areas, the best of the remaining nursery plants should be used to supply vacancies in mature tea fields. Vacancies in seedling tea should be planted with an appropriate soil reconditioning grass and infilled after a lapse of two years.\\n\\n# 3. Other considerations\\n\\nShade trees should not be lopped during dry weather to prevent fire hazards. However, all grass clearings must be lopped prior to a drought.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\n\\'Infilling\\' is a cultural operation undertaken in tea lands to replace those bushes that die due to various causes, with new healthy and robust plants so as to give a uniform cover and thereby, maximise productivity. Death of plants occur periodically in tea fields due to drastic cultural operations such as hard pruning and competition from neighbouring plants, unfavorable climatic conditions, lightening, soil variability, pest and disease attack. If the dead or weak plants are not replaced on time, productivity of the field will decline and ultimately become uneconomic. The presence of vacant patches in tea fields may also lead to the deterioration of the soil due to erosion and collapse of soil structure. Infilling should be carried out continuously to maintain productivity at the highest possible level. Provision should be made each year (at every prune) in order to recover the cost of infilling which would be based on the area to be pruned and the percent vacancies. The cost of infilling could be recovered in the first cycle of the envisaged infilling program depending on the price of made tea.\\n\\n# 2. Selection of areas for Infilling\\n\\nFor purposes of infilling, fields could be classified into three groups based on their performance.\\n\\n- Group 1: Fields to be replanted in the near future (within next 2-3 cycles)\\n- Group 2: Fields not earmarked for replanting in the near future (longer than 2-3 cycles)\\n- Group 3: Fields with poor, steep and rocky areas earmarked for diversification away from tea.\\n\\nIt will be clear that no useful purpose will be served by infilling vacancies in Groups 1 and 3. Attention should therefore be focussed on Group 2. Fields to be infilled should be selected two years prior to pruning and the causes for the weakness of such plants must be identified and appropriate remedial measures adopted to correct them. Thereafter, the patch should be planted with Mana/Guatemala/Vetiver grass till the field is ready for pruning. Infilling with new plants compatible with high yielding cultivars can also be undertaken to prevent weed growth after pruning. Soil amelioration/reconditioning under grass would improve the soil and the grass should be lopped periodically and the loppings used as thatch in situ. Infilling could be carried out in small patches or large blocks. The smaller patches may contain single or multiple infills.\\n# 3. Time of Infilling\\n\\nLarge scale infilling should be advanced to early part of the season so that by the time the vacancies are being supplied, the prunings left in the field will not be a hindrance. It is not advisable to delay the operation of infilling until after all the new clearing work is completed. Supplies must be put out as early as possible. In the Western sector it should be with the onset of the South-West Monsoon and in the Eastern sector with the onset of the North-East Monsoon. It is emphasised that young supplies have to compete for water and nutrients with surrounding mature bushes, unlike in clearings where competition is with plants of comparable age and size. It is essential therefore, that every possible assistance be given to enhance the establishment and growth of the supplies especially in the case of single or multiple infills in small patches.\\n\\n# 4. Where Not to Infill\\n\\n- Areas with underlying slab rock/hard pan\\n- Ravines\\n- Water logged areas\\n\\nNote: Infilling could be carried out in China jat fields with compatible cultivars.\\n\\n# 5. Infilling of Pest and Disease affected areas\\n\\n# 5.1. Eradication of Pest and Disease affected areas\\n\\nThe cause of vacancies should be identified before embarking on an infilling program. The vacancies caused by nematode infestation, root diseases and up-country live wood termite are problems connected with soil. These problems are confined to well defined patches and should therefore be identified in time and isolated as blocks by demarcation.\\n\\n# 5.2. Rehabilitation of Infested Blocks\\n\\nSuch blocks should be rehabilitated with grass after thorough up-rooting. These infested patches are to be identified after up-rooting; it may at times be difficult to do so.\\n\\n# 6. Plants used for Infilling\\n\\n# 6.1. Selection of Cultivars for Infilling\\n\\nUp-country: TRI 2025, N2, DT1, K145, TRI 3072, TRI 3073,\\n\\nMid-country: TRI 2025, DG 7, PK 2 (for Nuwara Eliya), DT 95, CY9, DNDG39, AN2, TRI 4042, TRI 4046.\\n\\nLow-country: S 106, DG 7, DG 39, TRI 2025, TRI 2026, TRI 2027, TRI 4042, TRI 4049, TRI 4052, TRI 4059, KP 204.\\n# 6.2 Size of Plants for Infilling\\n\\nRaise plants in large polythene bags 15 cm (lay flat) x 30 cm. Use well grown healthy plants and not what is left over in the nursery after planting the clearings: The planting of cuttings should be advanced to have plants ready in the planting season. Use around 15 month-old plants in the Up-country, 12-month old plants in the Mid-country and 9-month old plants at low elevations. The planting of the cuttings should be accordingly advanced to have the plants ready in the planting season.\\n\\n# Preparation of the Field for Infilling\\n\\nFork up all areas to be infilled, with particular emphasis on patches left vacant for sometime, to enhance root growth of young plants as well as to remove any pieces of old tea roots. Vacant areas should be planted with grasses until the field is pruned and infilling commences. Dig large holes, 30 cm in diameter and 60 cm in depth. In order to avoid cultural and management problems, it is suggested that infills in large blocks in old seedling tea fields be planted along the existing rows except when replanting is envisaged in the near future. It may be advisable to prune the adjoining bushes slightly lower (18\"), to ensure early establishment of infills.\\n\\n# 8. Aftercare\\n\\nThe infills should be protected by pegging, or with a small basket so that workers do not trample the plants while doing other cultural operations. Bringing into bearing should be practiced at the correct time. The side branches of adjacent bushes should be cut in order to permit sufficient light to reach the young supplies. Fertilizer should be applied as for young VP tea plants. Avoid use of herbicides in filled patches up to the first prune. The area should be kept weed free and thatched with an organic mulch.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\nShot-hole borer (SHB) (Xyleborus fornicatus Eichh:), synonym: Euwallacea fornicatus occurs in all tea-planting regions in Sri Lanka and is one of the key insect pests in elevations between 150 m to 1500 m. However, it also appears in elevations outside this range as a pest.\\n\\n# Immature Tea\\n\\nThe main stems and main branches of immature tea are susceptible to SHB. Protection of the main stem and main branches which give rise frame of the tea bush is vital.\\n\\n# Mature Tea\\n\\nThe immediate and direct damage that could result from heavy shot-hole borer infestation is due to breakage of primary branches arising from prune cuts. In the case of a new branch, after pruning, the basal section reaches the particular maturity that is preferred by the borer from about the 12th to 14th month. Such a branch generally remains susceptible to attack till about 36 months depending on the growth of the branch. Therefore, this period of primary branch susceptibility warrants protection from borer infestation.\\n\\n# Formation of Wood Rot\\n\\nIt is important to prevent wood-rot formation in the stems that have been galleried by the borer. Microbial organisms that cause wood-rot enter through the unhealed gallery openings as well as through the galleries exposed by pruning. Unless removed at the pruning time, such rotted wood can, in the long run, cause protracted debilitation of the bush frame resulting in crop loss.\\n\\n# 2. Integrated Management of Shot-hole Borer\\n\\nThe following Integrated Pest Management strategies can be adopted to overcome the shot-hole borer damage.\\n\\n# 2.1 Planting of Tolerant Cultivars to Shot-hole Borer\\n\\nThere is hardly any cultivar that is totally resistant to shot-hole borer. The mostly one can do is to select cultivars that show tolerance to shot-hole borer and have high innate capacity for callusing. Those that have shot-hole borer tolerance exhibit compensatory growth to a great extent. Those with high callusing properties have the ability to heal the wounds faster than others. If the wounds heal fast, there is no opportunity for wood-rot organisms to act on the dead cells of the wounds. However, both these factors (callusing and compensatory growth) can interrupt physiological activity in the main stem and retard the growth of the plant. Refer to the Advisory Circular PN to select tolerant cultivars appropriate to the region/s.\\n\\n# 2.2 Field Planting of Shot-hole Borer Uninfested Nursery Plants\\n\\nShot-hole borer uninfested nursery plants should be used for field planting.\\n# 2.3 Sanitary Measures at Pruning\\n\\nPrune-time sanitation measures should be adopted from the first proper pruning onwards to minimize wood rot that is induced by borer galleries: The dead snags (dieback that has undergone wood-rot) should be removed until healthy tissue underneath is exposed. Galleried parts of a branch should be shaved away until a clean prune cut remains. The large prune cuts should be painted with appropriate wound dressing/protective paint: Refer to the Advisory Circular PU 2.\\n\\n# 2.4 Burying of Pruning\\n\\nBurying of pruning besides its advantages of waste recycling and organic matter supply to tea lands, will destroy residual populations of SHB in infested branches and thereby minimize the chances of re-infestation.\\n\\n# 2.5 Maintain Bush Vigor to Encourage Growth Compensation\\n\\nGood Agricultural Practices on crop and land management recommended by the Tea Research Institute should be adopted.\\n\\n# 2.6 Chemical Control\\n\\n# 2.6.1 New Clearings\\n\\nAll new clearings located in areas prone to SHB infestation (mid-elevation) should be annually treated with the recommended insecticides as a prophylactic measure in order to facilitate good frame development: Refer to the Advisory Circular PU 4 for recommended chemicals, dosages, method of application and pre-harvesting intervals. Spraying is recommended in May/June in the north-east sector and in December/January in the south west sector. A repeat application is necessary after 6 to 8 weeks in the field where the SHB attack already been noticed.\\n\\n# 2.6.2 Mature Tea\\n\\nOnly application of Lime-Sulphur is recommended to protect mature tea fields from SHB attacks.

Introduction\\n\\nLive-wood termites of tea emerged as economically important key pests in the Low-country in the 1960s following a rapid increase in areas under vegetatively propagated tea. It was coincidental that the highest yielders of those clones that were used to replant old seedling tea areas also turned out to be the most susceptible host plants for the two most prevalent species of live-wood termites in the low-country.\\n\\nOn account of their high yield potential, cultivars TRI 2023 and TRI 2026 became very popular and were therefore the most widely planted. They were also the cultivars most susceptible to this group of pests, and as a result, the impact of termite damage on tea in the low country was immediately felt. The significance of live-wood termites as a group of primary, and very injurious, pests became apparent within a matter of a few years of large-scale planting of these two cultivars.\\n\\n# 2. Live-wood Termite Species Attacking Low Grown Tea\\n\\nThe most prevalent species of live-wood termites attacking tea in the low country are Glyptotermes dilatatus and Neotermes greeni. The former is commonly referred to as the \"Low-country Live-wood Termite\" (LCLWT) and is the most widely distributed of the two species. It attacks tea from sea level to an elevation of about 1,000 m a.m.sl. N. greeni is usually encountered in the upper elevations of the low country and also occasionally in the mid-country.\\n\\n# 3. Behavioural Pattern\\n\\nBiology, habits, preference for host plants, and dispersal are fairly similar for the species of low-country live-wood termites, and are described below:\\n\\n# 3.1. Dispersal\\n\\nAlates (winged reproductives) are the ones responsible for dispersal and the onset of monsoons in rainy seasons attend to dispersal flight and alight on suitable host plants. They pair off, shed their wings, and make their way into the bush through a \"soft spot\" on the stem. These \"soft spots\" originate as wounds on pruning cuts, mechanical damages, SHB and canker damages which have been acted upon by wood-rotting organisms to form dead wood. They facilitate easy and fast entry of the termite pair, and the greatest incidence of termite damage is seen to occur in fields that have been pruned 3-4 times without the adoption of sanitary measures.\\n\\n# 3.2. Colony Formation\\n\\nOnce inside the stem, the parent pair gradually excavates a short gallery and the female deposits the eggs, and the brood that develops from these eggs forms the initial colony. The first set of larvae, nursed by the parent pair, develop into nymphs which then take over the function of gallery-making and caring for all other inmates of the colony.\\nThe Nymphs which function as workers are an immature stage that can either develop further into mature casts like soldiers and reproductive stages or remain as they are with arrested development; according to the requirement of the colony: Therefore, they are referred to as false workers or pseudogates.\\n\\nThe nymphs developing into reproductive adults get transformed into two types. In one, the adult is devoid of wings but reproductively it is active and more sclerotized than others: They perform the function of egg laying and building up of the colony: These non-winged reproductives are referred to as \"supplementary reproductives\" as they, in effect supplement the function of the parent pair. The other type, which is also reproductively mature, develops wings but does not mate or lay any eggs in the parent colony: These are referred to as \"primary reproductives\" or alates and are responsible for the dispersal and founding of new colonies elsewhere. Their dispersal is associated with increased atmospheric humidity, especially during the pre-monsoon period, but swarming populations have, however; been encountered in the air throughout the year: This results in the susceptible host being prone to infestation at any time of the year:\\n\\n# 3.3 Type of Damage:\\n\\nUntil the main trunk is fully colonized and the second generation alates start to emerge in dispersal, the host plant does not exhibit any external symptoms. It is only when the galleries traverse across the conducting tissues of the vascular ring that free movement of water and nutrients are interfered with, within the plant: At this stage symptoms of wilting or scorching of individual branches are seen, particularly during periods of water stress.\\n\\nNewly planted VP tea, even though it is a susceptible cultivar; is not generally infested until after the first proper prune: This is because prune cuts which later develop \"soft spots\" for the termite alates to enter through; are created only at the time of the first prune. However; termite alates can enter through the stem and branch cankers in the new clearings. Termite-susceptible cultivars are generally known to be prone to excessive die-back following pruning: Once inside the bush, the individuals are perfectly protected from external mortality factors as they seal off the gallery openings with their faecal matter. With time, the infestation progresses deep into the core of the bush whereby the bush becomes debilitated, and this results in direct yield loss from the field.\\n\\n# 4. Integrated Management of LCLWT\\n\\nManagement of LCLWT requires a multi-pronged approach with the focus being centered on host-plant resistance. The important features of the integrated approach to manage LCLWT are given below:\\n\\n# 4.1. Planting of Tolerant Cultivars\\n\\nHigh-yielding cultivars with tolerance to this termite should be planted wherever possible. A use of mix of cultivars is also desirable. Planting the best suited cultivar for the region with Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) is essential for sustaining the productivity of the plantation. Please refer to Advisory Circular PN 1 to select tolerant cultivars for LCLWT.\\n\\nSpecial attention should be given to the cultivars TRI 2023, TRI 2026, TRI 2043 and TRI 4042 avoiding \"soft spots\" originate as wounds on pruning cuts, mechanical damages, SHB and canker damages in termite-active areas.\\n# 4.2. Adoption of Sanitary Measures at Pruning\\n\\nThe implementation of sanitary pruning plays a major role in an integrated system of management. All galleried stems should be removed by pruning them progressively down until no residual colony is seen within the stems. Such action should be taken from the second prune onwards since it is difficult to destroy the termite colony once established in the main stem of the tea bush.\\n\\n# 4.3. Protection of Pruned Cuts from Wood rot fungi\\n\\nProtection of the pruned cuts with an anti-microbial wound dressing is recommended to avoid wood rot formation (please refer to Advisory Circular PU 2 for dosage and application method).\\n\\n# 4.4. Protection from Stem, Branch and Collar Cankers\\n\\nRefer to Advisory Circular DM 5 for the canker management.\\n\\n# 4.5. Special Considerations with Machine Pruning and Mechanized Field Activities\\n\\nAs mechanized field operations for pruning and other agricultural practices tend to make damages and wounds in tea, special care should be taken during the operation and immediate treatment of wound dressings.\\n\\n# 4.6. Planting of Diversionary Hosts\\n\\nThe common low-shade tree Gliricidia sepium serves as a diversionary host to the low country live-wood termite. At the usual planting density of G. sepium (final spacing of 6 m x 7.2 m), it may not have the necessary level of cushioning effect on tea, particularly when the tea cultivar is susceptible. However, planting G. sepium as much as possible in the tea as well as in the surrounding non-tea areas would help to reduce the number of colony founders attacking the tea. Rotted snags in trees should be available during the swarming period to attract alates and those should be removed and destroyed after the swarming period.\\n\\n# 4.7. Strengthening of Natural Predation by Establishing Perching Points in the Vicinity of Tea for Birds and Bats\\n\\nNatural predation on alates would contribute towards the natural control of this pest to a large extent. It is necessary that these predators (birds and bats) are provided with suitable conditions such as perching points in the vicinity of tea.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\nTea Nematodes are microscopic organisms, which inhabit the tea root system and the soil around. Besides parasitizing and weakening the host root system, they interfere with the smooth uptake of water and nutrients, leading to severe nutrient imbalance and physiological stress in the plant. The economically important nematode pests of tea are:\\n\\n- a. Pratylenchus loosi Loof \"root-lesion nematode\" or \"meadow eelworm\"\\n- b. Radopholus similis (Cobb) Thorne \"burrowing nematode\"\\n- c. Meloidogyne brevicauda Loof \"root-knot nematode\"\\n\\n# 2. Symptoms of Damage\\n\\nThe typical symptoms of nematodes are slow decline in growth with the leaves turning a pale-yellow colour; premature flowering and fruiting and stunted growth of the plant. Similar symptoms could also be observed due to other stress factors such as drought, water deficit, water logging and ill-drained conditions and nutrient imbalances etc.\\n\\n# 3. Integrated Management of Nematodes in Young Tea\\n\\nPlant parasitic nematodes affecting tea could be disseminated through planting materials, soil, water and agricultural implements etc. In the presence of a susceptible root system of a good host, the residual nematode populations may get developed. Hence, nematodes once introduced to fields, they cannot be eradicated. Further, all tea growing areas are declared as nematode active or prone areas due to evidences on presence of either of the above three species. Therefore, every attempt should be taken for integrated management of nematodes by adhering to the following measures in young tea:\\n\\n- a. The area should be planted to rehabilitation grasses; Mana or Guatemala for a minimum period of 2 years. Mana is recommended to all tea growing areas. In areas where the tea has been found to be infested with the burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, Guatemala grass is not recommended as it is a good host. The C03 (Hybrid Napier grass- Pennisetum purpureum X P. minimum of americarnum) grass is recommended for lands with no months of rehabilitation as the biomass production is comparatively high (Please refer to Advisory Circular PM 12).\\n- b. Use of nematode free and healthy planting materials of recommended cultivars to the region for field planting (please refer to Advisory Circulars PN 1 on Suitability of Tea Clones for the Different Regions and PN 2 on Good Nursery Management Practices).\\n- c. Adopt all Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) recommended by TRI to ascertain healthy and vigorous plant growth.\\n- d. Prophylactic chemical treatments to bring down any residual plant parasitic nematode populations ensuring to avoid invasion to tea roots of the newly introduced tea plants as described under section 4.\\n# 4 Prophylactic Measures at Planting\\n\\nNematode control through chemical treatments is not economical due to the hidden nature of nematode damage in tea fields. Therefore, chemical application is restricted to the time of planting in the Integrated Management of Nematodes. As a protective measure to minimize any residual populations of parasitic nematodes, it is mandatory to incorporate a nematicide into soil in the planting hole at planting:\\n\\nThe recommended nematicides at correct dosages should be used as described in the Advisory Circular PU 4.\\n\\nAlternatively, 100 g of ground or powdered neem oil cake (neem poonac) could be mixed with soils in the planting hole.\\n\\n# 5. Nematode Management in Infested Young Tea\\n\\nWhen premature flowering and fruiting and/or any symptoms of debilitation have been observed, the affected areas must be checked for the presence of nematodes. Proper sampling should be done as per the method described in Advisory Circular PM 5 for nematode estimation at TRI. If the cause for such symptoms has been confirmed as nematodes, the following measures should be carried out over a period of 1-2 years:\\n\\n1. An \\'Infestation-specific nematode management recommendation\\' by TRI considering the field and crop conditions.\\n2. When nematode affected patches or blocks with heavy infestations have been identified, in situ block infilling; uproot affected tea in patches; remove all possible roots and rehabilitate the area with a suitable grass species.\\n3. Under a very light nematode infestation with a nematode tolerant tea cultivar, planting of nematode suppressive plant species such as Mana (Cymbopogon confertiflorus), Wild Sun Flower (Tithonia diversiflora), Wild Chrysanthemum (Artemisa vulgaris), and Marigold (Tagetes sp.) against Pratylenchus loosi and Radopholus similis and Vetiver (Vetivaria zizanoides) against Pratylenchus loosi.\\n4. Incorporation of soil organic amendments such as compost and well-decomposed reclaimable tea (at the rate of 2 kg per plant) or neem oil cake (at the rate of 500g per plant in two splits) depending on availability.\\n5. All Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) recommended by TRI to minimize impacts from other possible factors leading to stress conditions i.e., soil pH; ill-drained and dry soil conditions, graveliness, poor and imbalanced manuring etc.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\nAll species of pathogenic nematodes of tea inhabit roots and soil. However, their number and activity will depend on soil factors such as soil temperature, moisture, depth, use of agro-chemicals and organic matter etc. and plant factors such as age, cultivar and pruning cycle. Tea fields or nurseries may show symptoms caused by nematodes such as slow decline in growth, yellowing of leaves, premature flowering and fruiting and stunted growth etc. due to other stress factors such as drought, water deficit, clayeyness, hard pan and water logging conditions, nutrient imbalances etc. Before taking samples for nematode estimation, such factors should be ruled out. In order to assure a realistic nematode estimation, the sampling procedure should be different in a nursery and a field. Necessary sampling should be done to represent different cultivars, ages, conditions and symptoms of nematodes and weaknesses in plants of nursery or field. Nematode diagnosis is also proposed as an internal quarantine measure in assuring use of nematode free and healthy planting materials restricting dissemination of parasitic nematode species through planting materials in the tea growing areas.\\n\\n# 2. Sampling for Diagnostic Purposes\\n\\nEarly detection helps to check on the spread of nematode infestation. It could also curtail the extent of damage by enabling the adoption of appropriate and timely corrective measures. Sampling should therefore, be done at critical points where nematode introduction, establishment and or development could possibly occur. Such vigilance is most essential amongst nursery, newly planted young tea fields and mature tea. Infestation can only be confirmed by microscopic examination of soil and root samples. Soil and root sampling in the nursery/field should be assigned to a responsible person and be carried out under close supervision. An analytical report would only be as good as the sample submitted.\\n\\n# 3. Sampling in the Nursery\\n\\nSampling should commence about six months after the putting out of cuttings, or seed, in the nursery, when adequate roots have been developed. A minimum of 10 g of root material is needed per sample and the method adopted for sampling is as follows:\\n\\n- a. Take at least 5 plants at random from each bed of 1,000 plants.\\n- b. Cut off the feeder roots, after removing the plants from the bags, and transfer the feeder roots to a clean polythene bag.\\n- Cover the root sample with some moist soil to avoid drying.\\nLabel each bag with Estate name, Division, Cultivar; Bed No:- Age, Date of sampling and time.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate interpretation of the results of analysis and to give appropriate recommendations, it is necessary to send the duly filled Nursery History Fact Sheet issued from TRI:\\n\\n# 4. Requisites of Field Sampling\\n\\nSoil or root samples in the field should be drawn when the soil is adequately moist for at least 2 weeks after agrochemical applications and organic matter additions. Soil and root sampling should be avoided after any soil disturbances such as fertilizer. A minimum of one-month period should be given for sampling:\\n\\nIt is also necessary to submit the duly perfected Crop and Field History Fact Sheet issued from TRI along with the samples to receive a proper diagnostic report.\\n\\n# 4.1. Sampling in New Clearings and Mature Fields\\n\\nSampling of tea fields suspected with nematode infestation is important for diagnostic purpose and necessary recommendations: Both soil and roots are required for detecting the presence of nematodes in tea fields. The following method should be adopted to draw representative soil samples:\\n\\nAdditional samples may also be taken separately from fields and or patches and weak areas showing possible nematode symptoms. In fields due for pruning, sampling is recommended to be drawn 6 months prior to intended month of prune.\\n\\nDivide the field into blocks of 2 ha each using natural boundaries such as footpaths etc. wherever possible (Figure 1).\\n\\n1. Collect 25-30 samples at random points from each such 2 ha block.\\n2. Collect about 50 g soil from each sampling point. The samples should be taken 15 cm (6\") away from the base of the bush and at a depth of 15-25 cm (6-10\") with an Auger or ordinary crow bar (\\'Alavangoe\\'). Also collect feeder roots from each sampling point.\\n3. Pool the soil and root samples obtained from respective blocks and make about 500 g of the composite soil sample along with roots in a clean polythene bag and seal the bag properly.\\n4. Label each bag using a permanent marker with Estate name, Division, Field No., Cultivar; Block No., Age, Date of sampling and time. Also, a tag with above details may be inserted.\\n# 4.2 Sampling in Mature Fields Prior to Uprooting\\n\\nSoil and root populations of the parasitic nematode species in tea fields are expected to be aggravated with time. Hence, the residual nematode populations in mature tea fields due for uprooting would possibly serve as a source of inoculum in new clearings.\\n\\nHence, sampling is recommended to be drawn 6 months prior to intended month of uprooting to diagnose the nematode infestation level for adopting appropriate nematode management practices.\\n\\nIn fields due for pruning, sampling is recommended to be drawn 6 months prior to intended month of pruning.\\n\\nIn fields identified for uprooting, sampling is recommended to be drawn 6 months prior to intended month of uprooting to diagnose the nematode infestation level for adopting appropriate nematode management practices.\\n\\n# 5. Dispatch of Samples to TRI\\n\\nThe samples should be kept away from direct sunlight or any other condition that may promote heat during sampling and transport to avoid overheating in order to ascertain the life of the resident nematode populations.\\n\\nThe samples should be dispatched to the nearest Nematology Laboratories at Talawakelle, Hantane, and Ratnapura. Samples need to reach the laboratories compulsorily within 48 hours of sampling along with duly perfected Crop and Field Nursery History Data sheet. Undue delay could lead to dehydration and death of nematodes, thereby resulting in erroneous estimates of nematode counts.\\n\\nFigure 1: Method of collecting representative root and soil samples from young and mature tea fields for nematode estimation\\nFor a pre-arranged appointment to dispatch of samples to the TRI, please contact the respective Nematology laboratories.\\n\\n# 6. Important\\n\\nPlease note that the Institute does not accept the following samples for nematode estimation:\\n\\n- a. Water Samples: Testing of water for estimating nematodes is a laborious exercise which requires advanced techniques for physical recovery of nematodes from a large volume of water. If an estate is in a nematode prone area and known to have nematode infested fields, one should assume that the water courses running through the fields are contaminated. For further details on preventing contamination, please refer to the Advisory Circular PM 8.\\n- b. Soil for Filling Nursery Bags: It is mandatory that all soils intended to use for tea nursery work be sterilized. For selection of soils for nurseries and soil sterilizing techniques, please refer to the Advisory Circular PN 2.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\nFive species of mites cause damage to tea in Sri Lanka: Their common names are Red Spider Mite (Oligonychus coffeae Neither), Scarlet Mite (Brevipalpus californicus Banks), Yellow Mite (Hemitarsonemus latus Banks), Purple Mite (Calacarus carinatus Green) and Pink Rust Mite (Acaphylla theae Watt).\\n\\nTea mites are generally dry-weather pests, feeding on tea foliage but also attacking other vegetation, such as certain species of shade trees, cover crops, weeds, etc. Tea by roadsides and in pockets, exposed to various environmental and physiological stress factors, are prone to infestation by different species of mites.\\n\\nMites often make their appearance in isolated pockets at the beginning of dry weather; and unless controlled in time they can spread over an entire field causing significant loss of the crop. In particular, Scarlet Mite and Red Spider Mite could result in a setback to bush growth.\\n\\n# 2. Mite-prone Fields and Spot Treatments\\n\\nWhile some fields are prone to mite infestations, others are seldom affected. It is advisable to use spot applications of acaricides for prevention rather than as a curative measure after infestation.\\n\\n# 3. Rain and Mites\\n\\nThough mite infestation is generally less pronounced during wet weather, mild wet-weather conditions are not conducive to its eradication. In fact, light rain promotes Yellow Mite. Red Spider Mite infestations continue into monsoonal weather once the populations reach high levels.\\n\\n# 4. Damage Symptoms\\n\\n# 4.1. Red Spider Mite\\n\\nIt mainly attacks the upper surface of the maintenance foliage. This mite could be identified by the bronze colouration of its upper surface. Webs and minute white specks of cast skin are visible.\\n\\nThumb Nail Test: When a thumb is pressed against an affected leaf, a pin-dot mark of mite blood appears.\\n\\n# 4.2. Purple Mite\\n\\nOlder leaves are preferred. These mites occur on both surfaces of the leaf. The leaves attacked have a dull matt appearance and a purplish-bronze discolouration.\\n\\n# 4.3. Pink Rust Mite\\n\\nYoung leaves are preferred. Mostly found on the under surface of the leaf; but found on the upper surface as well. Petioles and tender stems are also attacked. The affected leaves become pale in colour and curl upwards. The veins and margins show a pinkish discolouration.\\n# 4.4. Scarlet Mite\\n\\nthe petiole. There is a dark-brown necrosis of the midrib and petiole. Heavy attack leads to severe defoliation.\\n\\n# 4.5. Yellow Mite\\n\\nMainly attacks the younger leaves, the first 2 or 3 leaves and the bud. Found in nurseries, young tea fields and fields recovering from prune. The flush is stunted, deformed and brittle, and pale and yellow in colour. The feeding area remains as a light corky-brown necrotic strip over the mid-rib.\\n\\n# 5. Integrated Approaches to Manage Mites\\n\\nIn order to ensure successful control of mites in tea lands, proper monitoring should be undertaken for obtaining an understanding of the spread, locations and specific times of the year where the mites occur.\\n\\n# 5.1. Planting of non-host plants of mites on road sides\\n\\nsuch as Artemisia spp, Wild sunflower as the road side with dust enhances the buildup of mite population:\\n\\n# 5.2. Improve and maintain shade during dry period\\n\\nto reduce stress for tea as the stressed plants are highly susceptible to mites.\\n\\n# 5.3. Ensure balanced fertilization\\n\\nto minimize stress.\\n\\n# 5.4. Chemical Control\\n\\nChemical spraying should be used only when the signs of mite damages appear and the infestation stages of the mites are known:\\n\\nPlease refer Advisory Circular PU 4 for recommended acaricides and dosages.\\n\\nFor effective control of mites, spraying should be done to the undersurface of the foliage as well:\\n\\nSpraying in plucking fields should be carried out immediately after plucking:\\n\\nWhen fields sprayed with Sulphur; the green leaves should be bulked with ten times the amount of flush from unsprayed areas.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\nThe root-feeding larvae of scarabaeid beetles (chafers or cockchafers) are commonly known as \"white grubs\" and about 90% of the reported damage in tea is in new clearings. Damage is also seen occasionally in fuel wood clearings. The damage in new clearings is significant in the following areas: Udapussellawa, Dimbula, Maturata, Pundaluoya, Pussellawa, Kotmale, Madulsima, Dickoya, Welimada, Nuwara Eliya, Haputale, Dolosbage, Hewaheta, Passara, Ratnapura and Galle. It is recommended that the plantations in Udapussellawa, Dimbula and Maturata districts should protect their new clearings from white grub damage as a routine practice through prophylactic treatments. Also, proper vigilance should be maintained to detect early infestation of white grubs.\\n\\n# 2. Cyclic Pattern of White Grub Development\\n\\nThe adult beetles deposit their eggs in the soil from about March to June. Large numbers of these beetles are often attracted to lights in March/April. The larvae start emerging from eggs from about June until about August. The ovipositing beetles can be encountered in the soil from June to November. Pupation commences generally in October, reaching a peak in January of the following year. The chronological pattern of the life cycle of cockchafers is the same in both south-west and north-east monsoon zones.\\n\\n# 3. Damage Symptoms\\n\\nOf the different species of white grubs found in tea lands, Holotrichia disparilis and Microtrichia costata cause economically significant injury to young plants in new clearings. The grubs can move from plant to plant; H. disparilis often chews the roots off completely, leaving a callused stump from which the plant may attempt to regenerate new roots. The grubs can also ring-bark the young plants at the collar. M. costata may also attack shade trees such as Acacia decurrence. Anomala superflua is a low country species attacking mainly timber species like Teak and also nursery plants and occasionally tea roots. Leucopholis pinguis attacks grasses, at times completely devouring the roots like in Mana and not allowing the grasses to recover. Damage to Guatemala does not generally kill the grass as adventitious roots develop from nodes above the damaged section.\\n\\n# 4. Attraction to Organic Matter\\n\\nAll attacks have been encountered in soils rich in decaying organic matter. The grubs are found predominantly in areas of the fields having high organic matter content and hardly any in sandy and gravelly areas. When compost is used in planting holes and or as soil amendments, white grub adults could be attracted.\\n# Integrated Approach to Manage White Grubs\\n\\n# 5.1 Land Preparation\\n\\nForking and cultivation of soil during land preparation will facilitate the exposure of white grubs to predators such as birds.\\n\\n# 5.2 Light Traps\\n\\nLight traps placed during March-May in white grub-prone areas will trap adult beetles in dispersal flight.\\n\\n# 5.3 Special Care with Agronomic Operations\\n\\nTo avoid white grub adult attraction, special attention and care should be taken for when compost is used in planting holes and or as soil amendments.\\n\\n- Live mulches such as Mana, grasses etc. are used.\\n- Organic matter is broadcast in tea lands i.e. compost; reclaimable tea and paddy husk etc.\\n\\n# 5.4 Artificial Mulching\\n\\nArtificial agriculture mulch should be done prior to the egg laying period which usually begins from March to May. Artificial agriculture mulch restricts egg laying by adult beetles around tea bushes.\\n\\n# 5.5 Chemical Control\\n\\nThe new clearings should be protected from the grubs during June-October. The grubs have an extended feeding period of about 8 months. Tea plants can succumb to grub damage during the 1-3 years. Repeat application may be necessary in the 2nd year if the grubs are active in the field during October.\\n\\nPlease refer to Advisory Circular PU 4 to select recommended chemicals and dosages.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Therefore, all good nursery practices should be strictly adapted as described in Advisory Circular PN 2 in order to produce healthy, vigorous and nematode free planting materials.\\n\\nThere is a possibility to use water running through tea lands in nurseries. When such water is used for irrigation purposes, the nursery plants may get contaminated besides the nursery hygiene is maintained. Hence, all preventive measures should be implemented in different regions depending on existing facilities.\\n\\n# 2. Source of Contamination of Irrigation Water\\n\\nWater courses running through infested fields wash away soil contaminated with parasitic nematodes and their eggs. When water from such sources is collected, there is a high probability of this water becoming contaminated. When contaminated water is used to irrigate tea nurseries over a period of time, it could transmit adequate numbers of nematodes to the roots of young nursery plants. Such contaminated plants not only suffer themselves, but also disseminate the infestation into the new clearings when they are planted out. Continued watering may supply a very few nematodes in suspension; i.e. bring about significant infestation levels for young nursery plants: 2 to 3 per 5 1 which is sufficient to.\\n\\n# 3. Methods for Prevention of Contamination of Irrigation Water\\n\\nThe following options are important in preventing water being contaminated with nematodes.\\n\\n# 3.1 Sedimentation of Run-off Ravine Water\\n\\nNematodes besides their light weight get settled in water with time due to gravity. When nematodes are immersed in water for a long period, they get asphyxiated and killed. The dead as well as the moribund nematodes sediment at the bottom of the water should be periodically drained out.\\n\\n# 3.1.1 Construction of a Sedimentation System\\n\\nA series of water tanks inclusive of two sedimentation tanks (A & B) and storage tank(s) (C) to suit to the capacity in accordance with the daily irrigation requirements should be constructed in a way that one feeds the other following a sedimentation period (Figure). The storage tank(s) (C) should be of adequate capacity to collect sufficient quantity of water that is needed to irrigate the entire nursery any day.\\n\\nPlastic water tanks available in the market; and cement tanks are suitable for the purpose. Outlet of the plastic tanks should be modified to suit the requirement shown in the Figure 1.\\nTwo tanks of similar capacity should be built with the outlet pipe of the first tank fitted about one foot from the base and leading into the second tank. The inlet of the second tank should be a few centimeters from the top. The two tanks should be built at split level (Figure 1). The tanks can be located at different heights on sloppy land. Allow the water in the first tank to sediment for 24 hours and open the water into the second tank the following day. The water in the second tank should also be allowed to sediment for another 24 hours and released into the storage tanks. The bottom 30 cm layer of the water in any tank should not be used for irrigation. Instead, it should be drained out to a pit or drain which carries the sediment out of the nursery. The outlet pipe that feeds the next tank should be fitted in such a manner that this bottom layer of water is not tapped.\\n\\nIt is also important that the sedimentation tank unit be regularly checked and monitored for proper functioning:\\n\\n|Tank 1|Volume X|\\n|---|---|\\n|Discard the 30 cm sediment|Allow water to settle for 24 hrs|\\n|Tank 2|Volume X|\\n|Discard the 30 cm sediment|Allow water to settle for 24 hrs|\\n|Tank 3|Maximum Volume 3X|\\n|Nematode free water for irrigation| |\\n|Clean the tank periodically| |\\n\\nSedimentation tanks (2) Storage tanks (1 or more)\\n\\nFigure 1: Schematic diagram of sedimentation tank unit\\n\\n# 3.2 Harness of a Well or a Spout\\n\\nIn the absence of a natural spring in the vicinity of the nursery to supply water for irrigating the nursery, a special well dug out with raised walls to a height of 2 feet above the soil level, to prevent contamination during rainy weather:\\n\\n# 3.3 Mini Tank Construction\\n\\nThe potential sources of such contamination are mainly from run-off water and ravine water. Therefore, these should be diverted away from tea lands through well-built drains. A stream may be blocked using a mini dam in such a way that water shall be retained as a reservoir. Such water shall be used for irrigation purposes after setting down for a minimum of two days.\\n# 3.4 Water Treatment using Bleaching Powder\\n\\nWater stored in a tank, reservoir shall be directly treated with Bleaching powder to disinfect all organisms including germs, bacteria and fungi and parasitic nematodes.\\n\\nFor water treatment purpose, commercial bleaching powder at the rate of                                kg per 1000         water basis should be used.\\n\\nBleaching powder should be thoroughly mixed using a stick and the treated water should be left for minimum of 12 hours prior to use for irrigation. Water treatment with bleaching powder shall be done in the evening for purpose of irrigation on the following day:\\n\\n# 4. Important\\n\\nIf the tea nursery is located in an estate with known nematode history, one should assume that the water courses running though fields could possibly be contaminated: This necessitates compulsory preventive measures described as above:\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Method of Detection of Termite-infested Tea\\n\\nThe Up Country Live-wood Termite (Postelectrotermes militaris Desneux) is reported in areas of Maskeliya and high elevations of Pundaluoya and Radella. It gains entry into the tea plant through the roots and constructs galleries within the woody tissues of the roots, collar, and finally the branches. As a result of this concealed habitat, an infested bush remains unnoticed. However, when branches are affected, prune cuts made at the time of pruning would show cavities filled with faecal matter, and occasionally the termites as well.\\n\\nDuring periods of moisture stress, one or two branches on a bush may also show signs of wilting. Since such wilting may be caused by reasons other than termite infestation, a few of these branches should be cut back and examined to confirm whether termite infestation is the cause, or whether there are other causes.\\n\\n# 2. Method of Uprooting Termite-infested Areas\\n\\nWhen termite-infested bushes are noticed at pruning, the frames of neighbouring bushes should also be examined carefully for signs of galleries. Such infested bushes should be uprooted until two concentric rings of plants show no further signs of infestation by termites. The particular patch should be blocked out, the area deep-forked and all tea roots, at least up to pencil thickness, should be removed. The uprooted plants and roots should be collected and burnt in situ, and should not be transported out of the infested area. A few old tar- or oil barrels could be used to burn the infested bushes and roots.\\n\\n# 3. Treatments\\n\\nEven though all infested plants and roots are removed and burnt in situ, in practice a few roots are likely to be left behind, from which re-infestation could subsequently occur. An extended period of rehabilitation (up to four years) would guarantee the decay of such root fragments, and so prevent re-infestation. It is therefore suggested that after having ensured a thorough root-removal operation following uprooting, commencing around December of the year of prune, the area be leveled and prepared for planting with Guatemala or Mana grass with the onset of the south-west monsoonal rains in May/June of the year following the prune. The grass should then be retained throughout the entire cycle (4-5 years) and the block planted to tea in the year of the following prune. During the extended period of rehabilitation under grass, any small, infested root fragments left behind would have decayed. The grass should be regularly lopped, and the loppings incorporated into the soil to improve the soil organic matter content and the soil structure.\\n\\n# 4. Integrated Management of UCLWT\\n\\n# 4.1. Suggested Programme for Termite Control\\n\\nTermite control on the estate scale should not be attempted haphazardly and a well-defined programme should be developed to control the pest. Work should be undertaken on a priority basis, and programmed in the following manner:\\n# Termite Management in Fields\\n\\nTermite-infested patches in fields that are to be retained for a long period (Group 2) and those to be uprooted and replanted at the end of the cycle (Group 1) should be very clearly demarcated.\\n\\n# Priority I\\n\\nTermite-infested patches in Group 2 fields should be uprooted in December of the year of prune as recommended above and planted with Guatemala or Mana grass in May/June of the year following the prune. These patches should be block in-filled with tea at the next prune only after a period of three years' rehabilitation (if it is on a four-year cycle) or four years' rehabilitation (if it is on a five-year cycle). As planting of Guatemala or Mana has to be completed by May/June of the year following the prune, the number of termite patches that could be tackled would depend on the availability of labour. However, if all termite patches in such fields cannot be properly treated prior to the planting of Guatemala or Mana by May/June in the year following the prune, they should be left under tea and tackled on the same basis in the following pruning cycle.\\n\\n# Priority II\\n\\nTermite-infested patches in Group 2 fields should be uprooted as recommended above, in December of the 2nd year from prune, and these patches planted with Guatemala or Mana in May/June of the 3rd year. However, if there are a large number of termite patches in fields due for uprooting and replanting, it may not be possible to have all of them treated and ready for planting with Guatemala or Mana by May/June of the 3rd year. In such instances, some of the patches may be uprooted in December of the 3rd year and planted with Guatemala or Mana by May/June of the 4th year at the latest. This will effectively eliminate the loss of identity of the termite patches when the entire field is uprooted. Following the treatment of termite patches, the general uprooting should commence in December of the 5th year; and the soil rehabilitated for a period of two years with Guatemala or Mana grass, followed by the usual two-year rehabilitation under Guatemala grass following the general uprooting of the field, as shown in the Schedule (Figure 1). When the method of treatment under grass, suggested above, is adopted, the termite-infested patches would have been under grass for about 5-6 years.\\n\\nIt is assumed that in all the A-category fields, and the better B-category fields, one would come across only a few termite-infested patches. If for some reason or the other, one encounters large numbers of termite-infested patches distributed throughout a given field, such a field should obviously be considered as one that needs to be replanted, and not as one needing an attempt at in-filling.\\n# Year after pruning\\n\\n| |1st May|2nd May|3rd May|4th May|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Group 2|Uproot termite infested patches|Rehabilitate Grass|Prune and Block infill with tea| |\\n|Group 1|Uproot termite infested patches|Rehabilitate Grass|Plant| |\\n\\nFigure 1: Schedule of proposed field operations to control Upcountry Live-wood Termite\\n\\nIf any of the Ccategory fields, find suitable blocks for replanting, follow the programme for Group 1 fields.\\n\\nNote: In five-year cycle estates, the period of rehabilitation of termite affected patches will be extended by one year:\\n\\n# 4.2.

Introduction\\n\\nParasitic nematodes, once introduced into fields, cannot be eradicated even by chemical means and hence, adopting preventive measures are of paramount importance in the integrated nematode management strategies. As such, in the integrated nematode management strategies, methods of control are largely confined to treatment of nursery soils.\\n\\n# 2. Nematode Control in Nurseries\\n\\nNurseries are the usual focal points of spread of nematode infestation. Nematode spread through planting materials has been evident within an estate, from estate to estate, estates to small holdings and even among tea growing areas in different agro ecological regions. Resultantly, poor early establishment and growth, yield decline, and even death of mature plants can occur. This is especially so with the usage of nematode tolerant tea cultivars that may possibly carry nematodes without showing symptoms in the nursery plants. It is therefore, essential to take all precautionary measures to prevent nursery plants from being contaminated with plant parasitic nematodes as there is no curative method and the yield losses cannot be compensated by any other means. Hence, disinfection of nursery soils and the premises is compulsory in all tea growing regions. Amongst various methods, soil fumigation using chemicals is the most effective means of nematode eradication in nursery soils. All soils and nursery premises should be mandatorily fumigated and ensuring nursery hygiene to eradicate all possible contaminations with nematode pests in view of guaranteeing nematode free planting materials.\\n\\n# 3. Prerequisites for Fumigation\\n\\nIn order to assure effective soil fumigation process and avoid failures, the following prerequisites should strictly be followed with advance planning in addition to the Good Nursery Practices (GNPs) specified in Advisory Circular PN 2.\\n\\n# 3.1 Nursery Site\\n\\n- Select a little elevated location above tea fields and a demarcated area with deep drains to avoid subsequent cross contaminations through runoff water from surrounding nematode infested tea lands.\\n- Avoid locations with a history of nematodes as far as possible to reduce risk of possible contaminations.\\n- Reserve an adequate floor space in the nursery site to spread the soil volumes for fumigation purpose, preferably a disinfected area.\\n- Select the premises away from resident areas and heavy human and animal movements to avoid exposure to the chemicals.\\n# 3.2 Raised Beds\\n\\nAlways use raised beds to avoid re-contamination through water and worker movements to ensure proper hygiene. Raised beds will improve the drainage of beds as well:\\n\\n# 3.3 Soil\\n\\nChoose the suitable soils in adequate volumes for fumigation after sieving the soils to avoid selecting dry soils: Moist the soil two weeks before fumigation to activate moribund weed seeds, which would enhance fumigation efficiency. However, avoid wetting the soil 5 days prior to fumigation, as the soil should not be excessively wet at the time of fumigation:\\n\\nKeep the soil preferably in a shed until use, to avoid drying and/or wetting. Turn the soil heap into a rectangular shape box with a height not exceeding 20 cm (8 inches) and any convenient width and length to accommodate the required soil volume (one cube of soil is equal to 100 cubic feet).\\n\\n# 3.4 Irrigation\\n\\nIrrigation water could contaminate the system in advance to ensure pathogenic nematodes free water: please refer to Advisory Circular PM 8 for arranging irrigation water or well water.\\n\\n# 3.5 Materials\\n\\nRequired quantities of fumigants recommended by the TRI (Please refer Advisory Circular PU 4), undamaged transparent or translucent polythene sheets of gauge 500, mammoties or shovel and watering can:\\n\\n# 3.6 Safety\\n\\nSelect masks, gloves and boots to suit the workers. Make the first aid kit available in the premises. Arrange the record keeping factsheet (Table 2) and Re Entry Interval (REI) warning board.\\n\\n# 4. Soil Fumigants\\n\\nSoil fumigants are substances or mixtures of substances which produce gas, vapour, fumes or smoke expected to reach and kill all forms of biological organisms. The objective of fumigation is best achieved when nematodes are fully active and the fumigant is readily transformed into fumigating substances: Also, it is necessary that the contaminated soil is exposed with free movement of fumigating substances and the treated soil is aerated to allow untransformed fumigants to disperse after the process.\\n\\n# 4.1 Mode of Action of Fumigation\\n\\nThe chemical on contact with soil moisture, is transformed into active compounds mainly methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) which are light in weight and volatile in nature. The production of MITC depends mainly on soil moisture and temperature.\\nThe MITC fumes penetrate spaces between soil particles destroying the active soil organisms and germinated seeds. As the effectiveness of fumigation process depends on concentration of the active compounds transformed and the length of exposure to target organisms, the texture and moisture of soil, physiological state of the organisms and degree of covering treated soil are the determining factors. Nematodes in root fragments, nematodes in resting or dormant stages, dormant seeds are unlikely to be destroyed while, all the free living and motile nematodes and germinating seeds are affected. Chemical transformation in soils occurs within 1-5 hours depending on the type of soil used. Odour of hydrogen sulfide and the strong eye-irritating properties of MITC can be experienced soon after application of fumigant: Immediate and complete covering would therefore be critical and helpful to avoid rapid loss due to volatilization and to enhance the performance of fumigation process. Exposure of soil for one week completely eradicates the nematodes: Thereafter, the cover should be removed to escape residual MITC fumes which would otherwise cause phytotoxic effects on cuttings. Mixing and turning the treated soils several times at regular intervals would help to enhance this process.\\n\\n# 5. Soil Fumigation Process\\n\\n# 5.1 Method of Soil Fumigation\\n\\nThe soils prepared for fumigation should be treated according to the schedule given in Table in order to ensure effective fumigation process.\\n\\n|Step|Operation|Time|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|1|Prepare soil heap and keep soil moisten|At least 2 weeks before soil fumigation|\\n|2|Nursery bed sterilization: Fumigation polythene layer|At least 2 weeks before soil fumigation|\\n|3|Pierce 1-3 holes in the metal lid of the Metham sodium bottle and the spread / sprinkle the required amount of fumigant evenly: Mix the chemical immediately into soil by turning the soil uniformly using a mammoty| |\\n|5|Level and turn the treated soil in to a rectangular shape box to a height not exceeding 20 cm (8 inches)| |\\n|6|Moisten soil lightly by a watering can| |\\n|7|Cover the soil immediately with a 500 gauge transparent polythene sheet and seal completely| |\\n|8|Remove the polythene cover|8th day after treatment|\\n|9|First mixing / turning of the soil|9th day after treatment|\\n|10|Second mixing / turning of the soil|12th day after treatment|\\n|11|Third mixing / turning of the soil|15th day after treatment|\\n|12|Bagging soil|22nd day after treatment|\\n|13|Planting cuttings|29th day after treatment|\\n# 5.2 Record Keeping\\n\\nAll the steps followed as per the time schedule including the names of personnel fumigating individual soil heaps should be recorded for reference by managers, inspectors and extension personnel: Sample of a record keeping factsheet is shown in Table 2. It is also advisable to maintain such records on display boards along with individually treated soil heaps.\\n\\n|Details|Soil heap No_|2|3|4|5|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Volume of soil prepared| | | | | |\\n|Amount of fumigant used| | | | | |\\n|Treatment done| | | | | |\\n|Restricted Entry Interval (REI) (8th day after treatment)| | | | | |\\n|Removal of polythene cover (8th day after treatment)| | | | | |\\n|First mixing (9th day after treatment)| | | | | |\\n|Second mixing (12th day after treatment)| | | | | |\\n|Third mixing (15th day after treatment)| | | | | |\\n|Bagging soil (22nd day after treatment)| | | | | |\\n|Planting cuttings (28th day after treatment)| | | | | |\\n\\n# 6. Nursery Bed sterilization\\n\\nPrevious nursery beds could possibly contain nematode infested soil as well as tea root fragments with residual nematode populations which could bring infestation to the new plants. Hence, it is essential to treat the nursery beds prior to stacking nursery bags in order to avoid possible contamination with treated soil.\\n\\nThe following should be carried out at least two weeks prior to stacking of the nursery bags filled with fumigated soil.\\n\\n1. Bed fumigation using bleaching powder at the rate of 10 g per square meter basis. It is important to remove all roots from the bed by forking.\\n2. Lay a thick gauge porous polythene over the bed.\\n\\nNever use un-fumigated soils such as soils from drains and beds for stacking and restacking purposes, and for other general nursery operations. Therefore, always maintain a reserve of fumigated soil for such purposes.\\n\\nIn case there is a history of nematodes in the nursery and/or surrounding area, please obtain additional advice on precautions and treatments from Nematologist; TRI.\\n\\n# 7. Safety\\n\\n# 7.1 Occupational and Residential Exposure\\n\\nFor personal safety, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and protective clothing should strictly be used by the workers during treatment.\\n# 7.2 Environmental Safety\\n\\nFollowing treatment; human and animal entry should be prevented by imposing Restricted Entry Interval (REI) of 8 days. A display board should be visibly posted at the fumigated site.\\n\\nAdequate measures should be taken to dispose used bags, containers and bottles of the fumigants to avoid dissipating chemical residues to air and water bodies.\\n\\nFumigants should always be stored under cool and humid conditions and away from direct sunlight and heat. Plan to use the whole bottle of Metham for appropriate volume of soil; once opened, do not leave any balance in the bottle for reuse.\\n\\nNote: As soil fumigation is mandatory for all the tea growing regions, nursery soils need not be tested for nematodes.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Introduction\\n\\n# 1.1 Mitigation of Nematode Infestations\\n\\nMicroscopic nematode pests once introduced and established in a tea land, it is difficult to eradicate. Direct damage and secondary effects by plant parasitic nematodes causes long-term and unrecoverable effects leading to instability in crop yields. Associations of other secondary disease complexes and physiological disorders along with inferior or poor crop and soil conditions further aggravate to minimize establishment; productivity and profitability of tea. Chemical control of nematodes is anyway not economic and practical in tea fields. Maintaining such areas would therefore be uneconomical as well as serve as nematode inoculums for rest of sections and or hitherto uninfested tea areas. Thus, all steps described below should be strictly adopted in all tea growing areas in view of mitigating the nematode incidence in tea.\\n\\n# 1.2 Importance of Replanting Nematode Infested Areas in Integrated Nematode Management\\n\\nReplanting is considered an important agronomic operation which replaces unproductive, old, nematode and other soil pathogen infested tea lands or sections as well as fields with stress factors limiting growth and productivity of tea. In this context; the aims of replanting are therefore to correct the limiting factors in the land for a sustainable, productive and cost effective newly established crop.\\n\\nProper soil sampling for nematode infestation should be carried out in unproductive immature or mature tea fields and prior to uprooting as per instructions given in the Advisory Circular PM 5. If nematode infestation has been ruled out as the main stress factor or leading to soil sickness in an area, the following steps should be rigidly followed during the replanting process. In the whole process of replanting, removal of plant and field limiting attributes, preparation of land, selection of appropriate sources of planting materials to suit to new planting should be given due consideration.\\n\\n# 2 Rehabilitation of Nematode Infested Areas\\n\\n# 2.1 Uprooting Procedure\\n\\nAll diseased and unproductive bushes should be uprooted manually or preferably with the aid of mechanical winches, if available. A single tea plant should not anyway be left in the area which may serve as a source of nematodes. The operation should be done from top to bottom in order to avoid subsequent nematode contaminations. If nematode infested tea bushes of a patch of land or section are to be removed, tea plants in the concentric circle should also be uprooted in order to ensure complete removal of nematode sources.\\nFollowing uprooting, the area should be forked thoroughly to a depth of about 45 cm (18 inches) and all tea roots, above the thickness of a pencil to be removed. Uprooted tea bushes should not be taken away and transported from place to place to avoid dissemination of nematode infestation. The roots removed from the ground should be collected and burnt in situ. Soils should not anyway be collected for nursery purpose (Please refer the Advisory Circular PN 2 for sources of nursery soils).\\n\\n# 2.2 Land Preparation\\n\\nAny soil limiting stress factor such as hard pan, ill-drained, water logging or gravelly condition etc. should be corrected to facilitate proper establishment of new as terracing and drains, shade tree plants. Also, along with leveling and land preparation, complete all other field operations such as planting etc. in order to minimize chances of subsequent nematode contaminations.\\n\\n# 2.3 Rehabilitation of Lands Using Grasses\\n\\nRehabilitation of nematode infested tea fields and or the area block identified for infilling process with a non-host plant species is a pre-requisite in all tea growing areas in view of imposing a long break for not allowing the nematode to survive and multiply further: Improvement of soil biological, chemical and physical characters conducive for the new crop is also envisaged through acceleration of organic matter status, structure, neutralize allelopathic effects of long-term cultivation of tea, break down residues of agro chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers etc. Resultantly, development and multiplication of densities of inherent natural enemies of nematodes such as bacteria, fungi, micro arthropods, free living and saprophytic nematode species are favored.\\n\\nThe nematode infested areas identified by the TRI be planted with Mana or Guatemala for an extended rehabilitation period as recommended by the TRI: Mana is recommended to all tea growing areas: In areas where the tea has been found to be infested with the burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, Guatemala grass is not recommended as it is a good host.\\n\\nC03 (Hybrid Napier grass Pennisetum perpureum X P. americarnum) grass is recommended for lands with no nematode history and for a minimum of 12 months of rehabilitation as the biomass production is comparatively high (Please refer TRI Guideline 02/2018 issued in December 2018). The grass rehabilitated areas should be maintained by regular lopping along with recommended inputs; fertilizers etc. (Please refer to Advisory Circular SP 6 for application rates). The grass should be cut periodically before flowering and incorporated into the land to improve the organic matter levels.\\n\\n# NOTES:\\n\\nPatna areas and lands with Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) are not considered as grass rehabilitated areas. Soils from grass rehabilitated areas meant for replanting should never be taken for nursery purpose instead, a separate grass lands should be maintained. Further; cut grass from rehabilitated areas meant for replanting should not be taken away for thatching purpose instead, a separate grass lands should be maintained.\\n# 3. Replanting\\n\\nThe rehabilitated land should be planted with uninfested, healthy and vigorous plants of nematode tolerant cultivars recommended to the region (Please refer to the Advisory Circular PN 1).\\n\\nAs an additional insurance against possible contamination of the young plants, it is vital to incorporate a nematicide in the planting as a prophylactic treatment (Please refer to the Advisory Circular PU 4 for recommended chemicals and rates).\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAIl rights reserved.

Of these TRI clones, more than 90 per cent are derived from a single plant designated as ASM 4/10. Under the guidance of the TRI, tea estates have also selected several clones and these are known as estate clones.\\n\\nAt present over 55 per cent of Sri Lanka's tea extent is under clones. The majority of the clones are TRI 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. This has led to a narrowing of the genetic base thereby making them vulnerable to pests, diseases, drought and other hazards.\\n\\nWherever possible, the following should be adopted in selecting planting material:\\n\\n- Select at least 5 to 6 clones depending on their suitability for the particular location and extent, provided that not more than 10 per cent of the estate is under a single clone.\\n- Clonal suitability can be tested by small-scale planting (at least 200 bushes).\\n\\nThe recommended clones given in Table 1 and their characteristics in Tables 2a and 2b will help in the selection of clones for planting:\\n\\nNote: Though not listed in this Circular; clones performing well in a particular locality could be considered for planting in that locality.\\n# Table 1\\n\\n# Recommended clones for planting in different climatic regions\\n\\n|Region|TRI 4000 Series|TRT 3000 Series|TRI 2000 Series|No. of Estate clones|No. of clones| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Up-Country|4006**|3013|2023**|CY 9|29| | |\\n| | |4034|3015**|2025|DN| | |\\n| | |4052|3016*#|2043*|DT [| | |\\n| | |4053|3018|62/5|K [45| | |\\n| | |4067|3019|777|N 2| | |\\n| | |4071|3020***| |NAY 3| | |\\n| | |4078|3072**| |PK 2+| | |\\n| | |4079|3073***| | | | |\\n|Sub total| | | | |8| | | | | |\\n|Mid-Country wet zone|4006**|3013|2023|CH 13|29| | |\\n| | |4042|3014|2024|CY 9| | |\\n| | |4046|3015**|2025|DC 7| | |\\n| | |4047|3017**|2026|DG 39| | |\\n| | |4053|3018|2027|DN| | |\\n| | |4071|3019|2043*|K 145| | |\\n| | | |3020***|62/5| |N 2| |\\n| | | |3025|62/9| | | |\\n|Sub total| | | | |8| | | | | |\\n|Mid-Country semi-dry zone|4042|3013|2022|DG 7|28| | |\\n| | |4046|3015**|2023**|DG 39| | |\\n| | |4052|3017**|2024|DN| | |\\n| | |4053|3018|2025|K 445| | |\\n| | |4071|3019|2026|KEN 16/3| | |\\n| | |4078|3022|2027|NAY 3| | |\\n| | | |3035|2043*| | | |\\n|Sub total| | | | | | | | | | |\\n|Low-Country|4004|3014|2022|DG 7|35| | |\\n| |4006**| |3022|2025|DG 39| | |\\n| | |4014|3025|2026|H 1/58| | |\\n| | |4024|3047|2027|KP 204| | |\\n| | |4042|3051|2043|S /06| | |\\n| | |4043|3052|62/5| | | |\\n| | |4047|3055|62/6| | | |\\n| | |4049|3069|62/9| | | |\\n|Sub total| |14| | |8| |5|\\n\\nSuitability criteria listed below are based on morphological characters and/or observations only for production of silvery tip teas:\\n\\n- * Suitable for high fertility regime\\n- ** Suitable for closer planting\\n- #

Introduction\\n\\nNursery management is an most important operation for successful tea cultivation in the field. The success of tea plantation depends largely on the vigour and the quality of nursery plants used. The primary objective of nursery management is to raise healthy, vigorous and uniform plants from suitable cultivars with minimum casualties over an appropriate period of time at a minimum cost. A plant raised in the nursery of about 30 cm height comprising approximately 15 leaves with 2 - 3 side shoots, and a well developed root system is considered as suitable for planting: Good Nursery Practices (GNP) including advance planning, correct and timely implementation of nursery operations are essential to produce healthy and uniform plants in a nursery as described below:\\n\\n# 2. Schedule of operations\\n\\nNursery activities for different tea growing regions are shown in Table 1.\\n\\n**Nursery activity schedule for different planting regions/monsoon sectors**\\n|Activity|Up country|Uva|Low country|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Pruning mother bushes (4 - 6 months prior to planting)|Nov, Dec|May, Jul|Apr, May|\\n|Soil collection, preparation, fumigation and bagging|Feb, Mar|Jul, Aug|Jul, Aug|\\n|Planting of cuttings|May, Jun|Nov, Dec|Aug, Sep|\\n|Supplying casualties (2 weekly intervals)|Jun, Aug|Dec, Jan|Sep, Oct|\\n|Fertilizer application (2 weekly intervals)|Aug, Sep|Jan, Feb|Oct, Nov|\\n|Disbudding (4 - 5 leaf stage)|Aug, Sep|Feb, Mar|Nov, Dec|\\n|Thumb nailing (7 - 8 leaf stage)|Sep, Oct|Mar - Apr|Dec, Jan|\\n|Restacking (4 - 5 month stage)|Oct, Nov|Apr, May|Dec, Jan|\\n|Hardening (5 - 7 month stage)|Dec, Jan|May - Jun|Mar, Apr|\\n|Field planting|Up country & Uva: in 10 - 12 months|Up country & Uva: in 10 - 12 months|Low country: in 8 - 9 months|\\n\\n# 3. Selection of site\\n\\nA nursery site must be centrally located to facilitate easy and constant supervision: The size of the site depends on the annual requirement of plants and the lie and slope of the land. Factors to be considered in the selection of a site are:\\n\\n- Proximity to a source of water\\n- Good drainage\\n- Protection from wind\\n- Proximity to the source of soil\\n- Proximity to the source of planting material\\n- Absence of overhanging branches of trees\\n\\n# 4. Preparation of beds\\n\\nThe ideal size of a bed should be about 1.0 m wide (3.5 ft) and could be of any convenient length of about 20 m (65 ft), with a pathway of 60 cm (2 ft) on either side for carrying out nursery operations. Beds are built in a north-south direction to receive sunlight throughout the day: The beds should be raised to\\nabout 15 cm (6 inches) for helping drainage and to avoid contamination of bags with nematodes subsequently through running water and, to avoid possible operational damages to the plants:\\n\\n# 5. Selection of soil\\n\\nThe growth of nursery plants largely depends on the texture (the proportion of sand, silt and clay) of the soil. Loamy soils containing sufficient fine particles (clay and silt) to hold up water together with sand to facilitate excess water to drain out are suitable for nurseries. The pH of the soil should be within a range of 4.5 and 5.5, preferably around 5 for successful rooting and growth. The soils chosen for bagging should be sieved using a No. 4 mesh to remove stones, pebbles and large root particles. The sources of soil suitable for nurseries are as follows.\\n\\n# 5.1 Grass soil\\n\\nA soil where Guatemala or Mana grass has been grown for a period of year or two with a substantial amount of un-decomposed roots that make the soil friable with good drainage and adequate aeration.\\n\\n# 5.2 Patana soil\\n\\nSoil collected from patna lands where grasses, ferns and shrubs have grown naturally:\\n\\n# 5.3 Jungle soil\\n\\nSoil with suitable texture from natural jungles, Eucalyptus or Pinus plantations blocks can be used. The surface organic matter (decaying leaves and twigs) should be removed prior to use.\\n\\n# 5.4 Sub soil\\n\\nThis is obtained from a depth beyond 30 cm from the soil surface. After sieving (with No. 4 mesh), its texture should be improved by adding fine sand proportionately (one part of fine sand with four to six parts of soil depending on clayiness of the soil):\\n\\n# 6. Soil treatment\\n\\nSoil should not be collected for nursery when it is too wet or dry in order to preserve the desired structure. Soil collected should be heaped in an enclosed area and protected from rain by thatching/covering until it is used. Soils collected from all tea growing areas should be fumigated before use to eradicate nematode pests in soil. Please refer Advisory Circular No PM 11 for current recommendations of the fumigants, dosages and application methods.\\n\\nAs an alternative to soil fumigation, soil solarization is also possible in areas where at least five hours of sunshine per day is available for a minimum period of six consecutive weeks. As solarization is subjective to local conditions it is necessary to obtain advice on soil solarization methods from the TRI by submitting weather records such as the number of rainy days and daily sunshine hours for the last three years.\\n\\n# 7. Alternate soil media\\n\\nWhen soil is scarce, organic materials such as tea waste, paddy husk and coir dust may be used along with soil. These alternate media will also help improve the quality and vigour of nursery plants. Other comparative benefits include reduction of soil requirement; labour use and cost and easy transportation due to the light weight of such materials:\\n# 7.1 Organic materials\\n\\nOrganic materials with the following requirements should be selected depending on their accessibility and availability:\\n\\n|Organic material|Specifications and requirements|\\n|---|---|\\n|Refuse tea|Well decomposed under natural conditions|\\n|Paddy husk|Fresh or partially decomposed; wastes obtained preferably from Japanese huller and free of bran and grain pieces|\\n|Coir dust|Fresh or decomposed; not from coastal areas|\\n\\n# 7.2 Methods of use\\n\\nDifferent alternate media could be used either in layer arrangement or as mixtures. The soil used for layers and/or mixtures should be fumigated as specified in the Advisory Circular No. PM 11. The organic material and soil should be lightly watered and mixed thoroughly prior to making the mixture.\\n\\n# 7.2.1 Layer arrangement\\n\\nThe top one-third (1/3) of the nursery bag should be filled with soil to facilitate early rooting with minimum causalities. The bottom two-third (2/3) should be filled with a mixture of organic material and soil in the ratios given below which will help establish roots and growth.\\n\\n|Organic material|Ratio of organic material|Soil|Remarks|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Refuse tea|1 : 1|100% refuse tea could also be used| |\\n|Paddy husk|1 : 1 or 1 : 2|1 : 2 for areas where prolonged dry weather is expected| |\\n|Coir dust|1 : 1|100% coir dust could also be used| |\\n\\n# 7.2.2 Mixture arrangement\\n\\nThe whole nursery bag should be filled with 1 : 1 refuse tea: soil or 1 : 1 paddy husk: soil or 1 : 1 coir dust: soil mixtures.\\n\\n# 7.3 Special considerations\\n\\nSpecial attention should be paid to give optimum water requirement when using the above growing media. As paddy husk retains less water; frequent watering may be required whereas refuse tea requires less water as it retains more water.\\n\\n# 8. Filling the polythene sleeves\\n\\nGauge of the polythene should be 150. Standard size of a sleeve is 10 cm or 4 inches in diameter (12.7 cm or 5 inches layflat) and 23 cm or 9 inches long and, about 400 such sleeves can be made from 1 kg of polythene sleeve of 150 gauge. The bottom end of the bag is left open, and a few holes punched on the sides of the bottom half to facilitate drainage. About one cube of soil is required to fill about 1000 sleeves.\\n\\nBigger polythene sleeves of 30 cm or 12 inches long and 15 cm or 6 inches wide (layflat) are used to raise bigger plants for infilling purposes as they are kept longer duration (15 - 18 months) in the nursery.\\nWhen filling the sleeves, a small layer of lightly wet soil is gently rammed at the bottom to make it hold on to the sleeve: Then fill by gently pressing the soil in but not ramming it hard, to avoid formation of a hard layer that may impede root development: No air pockets should be left in the soil while filling as it could result in sagging of the bag:\\n\\n# 9 Source of planting material\\n\\nVegetatively propagated plants are raised from internodal cuttings consisting of one leaf of the shoot. The choice of cultivars, both for replanting and infilling, will depend on the desired characters. Please refer TRI Advisory Circular PN for details on selecting suitable cultivars. Cuttings should be obtained from properly managed multiplication plots (mother bushes) as described below:\\n\\n# 9.1 Preparation of mother bushes and planting of cuttings\\n\\nIt is recommended to remove the terminal buds, about 2 to 3 weeks before taking shoots off the mother bushes and then followed by a foliar application of Zinc Sulphate and Urea at 2 to 3% each in order to break dormancy of axillary buds and stimulate growth. Please refer TRI Advisory Circular No. SP 4 for details on fertilizing mother bushes.\\n\\n# 9.2 Collection of shoots\\n\\nShoots must be obtained from pruned bushes over four years in age. Vigorously grown erect shoots will be available for collection about four months after pruning in the low country and six months after pruning in the up country: However; this period may vary with weather conditions, elevation and cultivar: Generally 3 to 5 suitable cuttings per shoot (depending on the quality of shoot) and 15 to 25 shoots could be obtained from a well maintained mother bush. Approximately 70 to 100 cuttings could be obtained from a bush. Shoots should be collected early in the day:\\n# 9.3 Transportation of shoots\\n\\nOnce shoots are removed from mother bushes they should be kept in a shaded place preferably in a container filled with water to avoid drying up. Adequate measures should therefore be taken to minimize drying up and sun scorch of shoots during transportation.\\n\\n# 9.4 Method of taking cuttings\\n\\nOnly single node cuttings from a suitable shoot (Figure 2) are recommended. Cuttings should be taken from the middle portion (Figure 1) of the shoot leaving the apical tender portion and the basal leaf (Figure 3) should be discarded. When obtaining single node cuttings, the upper cut should be made sloping upwards just above the axillary bud and the lower cut sloping downwards.\\n\\n2.5\\n3.8 cm\\n\\n# Figure 2\\n\\nA suitable single node cutting\\n\\n# Figure 3\\n\\nUnsuitable cuttings\\n\\n- damaged mature leaf\\n- overgrown axillary bud\\n- flower bud\\n- stem too short\\n- stem too long\\n- excess stem ahead the leaf\\n# 9.5 Planting of cuttings\\n\\nSoil in the polythene bags should be lightly watered and gently pressed prior to inserting cuttings. Only one cutting should be planted per bag by inserting vertically down into the soil. Planting of cuttings should be done in the manner the leaves are oriented in one direction at an angle to the row: The soil around the cutting should be gently pressed by fingers to ensure firm anchorage. Cuttings of different cultivars should be planted separately and labeled.\\n\\n# 9.6 Promotion of rooting of cuttings\\n\\nIn order to enhance callusing and rooting of cuttings particularly in the case of slow rooting cultivars, the basal ends of the cuttings may be treated with a quick dip of a growth hormone by immersing the cuttings up to 1.5 cm in Indol Butric acid (IBA) solution of 6000 ppm (6g IBA in 1 liter of water):\\n\\n# 9.7 Propagation under sealed polythene\\n\\nPropagation could be done under a sealed polythene tunnel to have considerable savings on water and labour: After cuttings are planted, the bags as well as beds are given a thorough watering and covered immediately with a transparent, 300 gauge polythene sheet, resting on semi-circular iron or bamboo hoops. The edges of the sheet are buried well on all four sides and made air-tight to create a propagating environment.\\n\\nNo watering is required in the tent as the water applied initially would be adequate for internal circulation within the tent: If the moisture in the tent is inadequate, the plants should be watered and sealed again. When the water is condensed inside the tent; they should be placed back in the potted bags by gently tapping the surface of the tent at frequent intervals especially in the mornings. The cover could be retained for 1½ - 3 months, depending on the rate of growth, and removed in stages extending over a few days. This system brings about a relatively fast vegetative growth of the cuttings, especially in slow-growing cultivars as well as in nurseries in exposed or cold areas.\\n\\n# 10. Shade for nurseries\\n\\nCuttings should not be exposed to direct sunlight and diffused or indirect sunlight of about 20 - 25% light is adequate. The different types of nursery shade are described below:\\n\\n# 10.1 Low shade with bracken fern\\n\\nBracken fern (Gleichenia linearis) can be inserted in clusters of about 2 - 3 fern shoots between polythene sleeves. The fern stalk should be free from leaves up to 25 cm from bottom and shade should be provided by the fern canopy above this height: Uneven shading and difficulty in supervision are drawbacks of this type of shade:\\n\\n# 10.2 Low shade with coir matting\\n\\nCoir matting of Gmm mesh, with a standard size of 9 m x 3 m (30\" x 9\") is laid on a frame of iron or bamboo hoops, fixed across the length of the bed at 2 m apart. Rods, 2 m long with loops at the end, are used to link the hoops together and provide additional support.\\n# 10.3 High shade with coir matting\\n\\nThough the initial cost is high, this type of shade is preferred as it allows easy walking in and carrying out nursery operations under the permanent structure. The frame (wood, galvanized piping or concrete posts) is erected slightly sloping to receive more of the morning sunlight; and also to prevent excessive drip during heavy rains. Posts are 2.4 m high, spaced 3.5 m x 3.5 m apart, and the frame stands 2 m above the bed after erecting. Coir matting of 6mm mesh should be used as shade material. Alternatively, synthetic nettings could be used in high elevation estates.\\n\\n# 11. Aftercare operations\\n\\n# 11.1 Watering\\n\\nIn the early stages, regular watering two to three times a day is necessary and watering should be regulated depending on the weather. Wetting the coir matting will help retention of moisture in the nursery.\\n\\n# 11.2 Fertilizer applications\\n\\nFertilizer should be applied only after the cuttings have been rooted, which would be between six to eight weeks in the Low country and ten to twelve weeks in the Up country. Please refer Advisory Circular No. SP 1 for details of fertilizer application.\\n\\n# 11.3 Restacking plants\\n\\nFor easy management of the nursery and to obtain plants uniform in size, the plants should be separated by restacking them into two to three height classes during the fourth to fifth month. A second restacking could be done during the fifth to seventh month. While restacking, the moss and hard crust formed in the surface soil of the nursery bags should be loosened by gently dibbling in with a pointed stick to permit better percolation of water and fertilizer. This leaves the soil in a friable condition.\\n\\n# 11.4 Hardening of plants\\n\\nAs more leaves are formed, plants need exposure to more sunlight for better growth. This must be done gradually as sudden exposure may lead to leaf scorch. Between the fourth and sixth month (based on the elevation), the side of the coir matting should be raised and the plants should be exposed to indirect sun until the shade is completely removed.\\n\\n# 11.5 Encouraging early spread\\n\\nFor maximum gain, plants should be encouraged to form a low spread at an early stage. The following operations would encourage formation of lateral branches from the lower level of the main stem.\\n\\n- Disbudding: To induce effective lateral branching, the terminal bud should be removed at four to five leaf stage. This should be repeated on the axillary shoots also as they grow.\\n- Thumb-nailing: At about seventh to eighth leaf stage, after the root system is well developed, the terminal bud and the two leaves immediately below should be pinched off to induce growth of lateral branches.\\n\\n# 11.6 Pest and disease control\\n\\nCommon pests found in nurseries are the tea tortrix and the yellow mite. When the nursery period is extended, shot hole borer can become a problem in susceptible cultivars. Mealy bugs may.\\nbecome problematic under ill-drained and clayey soil conditions. Blister blight and black blight disease (in the Low country) on young leaves during monsoon condition also can be a problem.\\n\\nPlease refer TRI PM and DM series of Advisory Circulars for current recommendations on control of insect and mite pests and, leaf diseases in nurseries.\\n\\nWith proper timing of operations along with good management practices, nursery tea plants with appropriate quality standards can be produced within a period of 10 - 12 months in Up country and Uva regions, and 8 - 9 months in Low country regions.\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

T3, Serial No. 11/72 and T4, Serial No. 12/72)\\n\\nA satisfactory liquoring standard is important for good CTC manufacture; not only to ensure teas of a high standard of plucking but also to prevent the CTC rollers from becoming prematurely blunt by cutting into coarse leaf, stalk and woody material.\\n\\n# Withering\\n\\nGreen leaf is given a light wither, corresponding to about 28-32% outturn of made tea to withered leaf, in troughs: satisfactory make, even if a drastic reduction in the duration of wither is necessary. It is important that the wither should not get harder than an upper limit of 32% to ensure a satisfactory make.\\n\\nThe withered leaf is then passed over a withered leaf sifter with a No. 4 (or a larger mesh) to eliminate sand and small stones that may have got picked up accidentally in the field and in the weighing sheds.\\n\\n# Cutting\\n\\nSuccessive cuts in CTC machines arranged in series. The leaf is fed into a pre-conditioner such as 15\" (380 mm) rotorvane and then given 3 or more cuts before being conveyed to the first CTC machine connected to remove iron particles, which might damage the rollers. Arrangement sketches, details of roller adjustments, rolling programmes etc., are given in other circulars.\\n\\n# Fermentation\\n\\nThe period of fermentation is generally shorter than with conventional manufacture, ranging from 1 hour 15 minutes to about 2 hours 10 minutes depending on the rate of fermentation of the leaf. It is possible to ferment the leaf on tables, by reducing the spread to 25 mm. Fermentation machines with a forced draught of air could be used, but it is also advisable to pass it first through a ball-breaker as this operation minimizes the formation of agglomerates which inevitably find their way into the off grades.\\n\\n# Drying\\n\\nThe drying process is carried out in either a Fluid-Bed Drier (FBD) or in a conventional ECP drier. However, FBD is considered to be sine qua non for CTC manufacture. If FBD is used, the inlet temperature should be maintained at 121°C with a weir height of 8.9 cm. If ECP drier is used, the period of drying should be 21 minutes with an inlet temperature of 93°C and exhaust temperature of 54°C.\\n\\n# Grading\\n\\nThe grading operation is simplified by the absence of a big bulk, and by the manufacture of only a limited number of grades. Generally, either a Vibro Screen or a Chota Sifter or a Trinick Sorter with mesh sizes of 10, 12, 16, 30 and 40 is used. When a Chota Sifter or a Vibro Screen is used, tea particles passing over the 12 mesh are crushed, resifted and classified in secondary grades. BP1 is taken through 12 and over the 16 mesh. What passes through 16 and over the 30 mesh is PF1 and through 30 and over 40 is PD. What passes through 40 mesh is D1.\\n# Some variation is expected in the sieve size description of grades and even in sifting procedure according to trade requirements\\n\\nCrushed teas, rejects from the winnower (used for subsequent cleaning but the procedure outlined here is that which is commonly followed) and the electrostatic stalk extractor are used to form the off grades BP1, F1 and F2 and D2.\\n\\nThe trays in a Trinnik sorter should be fixed in an ascending order of perforation sizes (No. 30, 24, 16, 12) and grades separated as explained above. For example, BP1 is taken through No. 12. Trinnick sorters could be used with only 4 sizes of meshes fitted, if necessary.\\n\\nBright infusions with good liquoring colour and strength are necessary attributes of a good CTC tea, but the dry leaf appearance standard is not as important a factor as with orthodox operations.\\n\\n# AREAS SUITABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CTC TEA IN SRI LANKA\\n\\nIncreasing popularity of the tea bag in Europe and the demand for quick brew teas have resulted in the formation of a very considerable market for cut leaf curl (CTC) teas. A proportion of this type of tea is manufactured in Sri Lanka and it has now become very necessary for us to take a serious view of this expanding market.\\n\\nStrong, coloury liquors are essential characteristics, but dry leaf appearance is not as important as sales factor as it is with teas of orthodox manufacture.\\n\\nThe requirements of this specialized market for CTC tea are, at the moment, supplied by India and East Africa. CTC tea production in India is based largely in the low elevational districts of Assam, Dooars and West Bengal in the North East; and in more limited quantities, from the plain tea producing areas of Kerala and Madras State in the South.\\n\\nDistricts such as Darjeeling, Nilgiris and the Anamalais which produce flavoury teas in season, and high quality teas for most of the year retain almost exclusively the orthodox system of manufacture. East Africa, on the other hand, experiences no pronounced flavoury season as in the Uva and Dimbula-Dickoya districts of Ceylon, and produces mainly the CTC variety.\\n\\nLooking into the factors which have demarcated CTC producing areas from districts producing orthodox black teas in other countries, it would seem that estates in the low and low-mid elevations of Sri Lanka would be those best suited for producing the type of CTC tea that would find its way into the tea bag. High elevational teas could also be converted into CTC but these estates would then have to be geared for dual manufacture under prevailing very best market conditions, by not offering the trade an uninterrupted supply of a given line of manufacture.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

A weighed sample of tea is kept in an oven controlled at 103 ± 2°C for a minimum of four hours and is weighed again; the difference in weight is the weight of moisture in the sample and this is quoted as a percentage of the original weight. This method, though accurate, is time-consuming and is not suitable for routine use in tea factories. There are several types of moisture meters, however, which give a quick reading, but with lower accuracy. One such instrument is the Infra-red Moisture Meter. In this instrument, the moisture in the tea sample is driven off by the heat from the infra-red lamp. Initially, only the moisture is driven off but subsequently the tea is burnt. Therefore, the time for which the sample should be dried is critical in order to get a reasonably accurate value of the moisture content. It is not correct to dry the sample until such time that traces of smoke are seen, as this cannot be observed accurately. The switch-ON time, the time for which the sample should be dried, is determined by the calibration procedure given below:\\n\\n# Procedure for Calibration\\n\\n1. Level the meter using a spirit level.\\n2. Check the scale at various points using actual weights. Slight adjustments may be necessary using the knob provided.\\n3. Adjust the height of the bulb so that tea will just start to burn (smoke) in about 10 minutes after switching on the bulb and note this position. This will ensure that the required switch-on time is well within 10 minutes.\\n4. Collect some fired dhools from the drier mouth and divide into two samples. Send one sample to the Technology Division of the TRI or to a suitable laboratory for accurate determination of the moisture content using the Oven method. This sample should be packed in a tin leaving no air space and sealed with adhesive tape.\\n5. Place the standard (usually 10g) quantity of the dhool from the second sample on the moisture meter pan. Switch on the bulb and note the reading every 30 seconds commencing from 3 minutes to 10 minutes.\\n6. Repeat as in (5) and take the average of the two sets of readings if the readings are too different for consistency.\\n# 7\\n\\nOnce the oven-method moisture readings are sent to the estate, read out the time, which corresponds to the readings obtained as in (6).\\n\\n# 8\\n\\nThe above time spends on the distance of the bulb from the pan, as such, it should be kept constant as determined in (3).\\n\\n# 9\\n\\nThe switch-on time varies with the particle size, therefore the time should be determined separately for each dhool and each grade.\\n\\n# 10\\n\\nThe above time also depends on the power supply voltage, therefore, calibration and subsequent use of the instrument should be carried out more or less at the same voltage.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved: No part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means; electronic or mechanical, including photocopying, recording or information storage and retrieval without permission in writing from the Director; The Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='cb556ce0-e88a-4f30-a981-f183b0735377', embedding=None, metadata={'filename': 'TRI_Advisory_Ciculars_PT_06.md', 'extension': '.md', 'url': 'https://www.tri.lk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TRI_Advisory_Ciculars_PT_06.pdf', 'title': 'MOISTURE LEVELS OF BLACK TEA', 'issue_date': Timestamp('2004-03-01 00:00:00')}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# INSTITUTE\\n\\n# ADVISORY CIRCULAR No_PT 6\\n\\nIssued in March 2004\\n\\nSerial No: 1/04\\n\\n# MOISTURE LEVELS OF BLACK TEA\\n\\n(This replaces the Advisory Circular No. T7, Serial No. 2/81)\\n\\nThe most important factor that determines the keeping qualities of tea is the moisture content. At high moisture levels the deterioration of the desirable tea characteristics is faster and these teas are found to lose briskness with time and end up as flat teas. The moisture content of tea could be kept within the desired limits by the following:\\n\\n- Proper drying of tea.\\n- Preventing excessive moisture absorption during grading and packing.\\n- Packing tea in proper containers such as plywood tea lined with aluminium foil or multiwall paper sacks.\\n\\nThe moisture content of properly fired dhools when sampled at the drier mouth should be in the region of 3% and that of the tea at the time of packing should preferably be less than 5%.\\n\\nIn order to dry tea properly, the following operating conditions are recommended for the ECP Drier and the Fluid Bed Drier (FBD):\\n\\n# ECP\\n\\n- a) Inlet air temperature of 190 -195 °F (88 - 91 °C).\\n- b) Exhaust air temperature recorded by a thermometer placed one-third the length away from feed end and 6 inches (15.2 cm) above top tray of 125-135 °F (52 - 57 °C).\\n- c) Residence time (i.e. time through the drier) of 21 minutes.\\n- d) Air volume of 30 cfm per lb (1.87 cubic meters per minute per kg) moisture evaporated per hour, with uniform distribution over the top tray: By-pass valve at fully closed position.\\n- e) Adjustment of feed rate so as to maintain recommended exhaust temperature.\\n- f) The fall through of tea should be minimized by having suitable tray perforations.\\n\\n# FBD\\n\\n- a) Inlet air temperature of 260 °F (127 °C).\\n- b) Height of discharge weir in drier at 3 - 4 inches (8.9 - 10 cm).\\n- c) Tea bed temperature near discharge end (recorded by a thermo probe immersed 6 to 8 inches (15.2 - 20.3 cm) from the discharge weir of the drying chamber) at 190-200 °F (88 - 93 °C).\\n- d) Air volume of 2000-2500 cfm (56.6 - 71 cubic meters per minute) per drying section.\\n- e) Volume control dampers adjusted so as to get well fluidized tea bed in all sections.\\n- f) Adjustment of feed rate so as to maintain the recommended tea bed temperature near discharge end.\\n# The absorption of certain amount of moisture by tea prior to and during grading\\n\\nas well as packing is inevitable but care should be taken to prevent excessive gain. One of the first precautions to be taken is to maintain the grading and packing rooms in a reasonably dry condition. Un-graded teas should not be left lying about in heaps but should be stored in covered boxes. Graded teas should be binned as soon as possible.\\n\\nTea should be graded daily and must not be left exposed longer than necessary; this should be carried out as a routine and records should be maintained.

Introduction\\n\\nDiseases, insect, mite and nematode pests and weeds occur in tea, in different stages of the crop, and at different times of the year. Therefore an integrated approach (Integrated Pest Management: IPM) is recommended for efficient and timely management of pests in tea, which consists of various agronomic, cultural, biological and chemical strategies in a rational and environmentally friendly manner: Rational use of fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, and weedicides is part of integrated management of diseases; insects, mites, nematodes and weeds respectively.\\n\\nIn parallel, it is necessary to strengthen biological systems and improve cultural practices in order to promote the build-up of tolerance in plant and biological-control organisms in the environment; and to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests, diseases and weeds in tea fields. Also, use of tea cultivars resistant / tolerant to the different diseases and pests is the prime component in the IPM:\\n\\nAs tea is a food commodity for human consumption, there is a growing concern among health-conscious consumers on pesticide residues that may be present in tea. Therefore, it is advisable to use pesticides in tea fields carefully, in order to minimize the residues in made tea, effects on workers and non-target organisms in the eco-system: Moreover; the cost-effectiveness and the social acceptance of pesticide usage also have to be considered for the sustainability of the tea industry:\\n\\nThe chemicals and their use in tea as Plant Protection Products (PPPs) are subjected to change periodically to meet the requirements of consumers, social and environmental acceptance etc. It is extremely necessary to ensure that the pesticide residues in made tea at levels below the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) set for different pesticides by different countries.\\n\\nWhen PPPs are applied to tea cultivations, it is necessary to strictly adhere to specific Pre-Harvest Intervals (PHI) and bulk green leaf from the sprayed and unsprayed fields or made tea at a ratio of keeping and monitoring on rational use of the PPPs are made mandatory for traceability and regulatory purposes: This would help dilute and minimize the pesticide residues in the made tea. Proper record keeping is essential.\\n\\n# 2.

Introduction\\n\\nFor disease management in tea, an integrated approach inclusive of cultural, biological and chemical methods is recommended as specified in Advisory Circulars DM1 - DM7.\\n\\nTwo fundamental groups of fungicides are used to control tea diseases. They are either contact or systemic. Contact fungicides can kill a pathogen (fungus) only upon contact and are not absorbed into plant tissues. Systemic fungicides, on the other hand, have the ability to be absorbed into plant tissues and therefore may leave behind residues for a longer period with better controllability. This can become counterproductive when it comes to residues in the final product (made tea). Therefore, this makes it necessary to take all the precautions in resorting to control diseases using systemic fungicides. It is very important to use only the recommended fungicides as per TRI guidelines following the required Pre Harvest Interval (PHI):\\n\\n# 2.

Adopt a selective spraying program in order to retain desirable weeds and to control resistant weeds. Such resistant weeds should be treated with specific herbicides at dosages recommended. Alternately, other more effective control measures may be adopted.\\n2. Select the most suitable herbicide based on the range and growth stage of weed species present in the field. Use correct dosage of herbicide and mix thoroughly in clean water and then make up the spray volume required to cover the area to be treated. Wash spray tanks thoroughly in clean water before use to avoid any contamination.\\n3. Maintain the number of herbicide applications for the year to a minimum (maximum two from a single herbicide); use a range of herbicides of different mode of action in rotation rather than continuing with a single herbicide. This would help in preventing build-up of resistant weed species.\\n4. Do not spray herbicides on creepers growing over the tea bush. These should be pulled down and laid on the inter-row space and then sprayed. Mature woody plants and deep-rooted species should be slashed, and the regrown tender parts to be sprayed.\\n5. Spray weedicides when weeds are relatively young, before they flower and bear seeds.\\n6. Select a calm day for spraying, as wind could carry the spray drift away from the intended area of spray. Also avoid spraying during very hot periods of the day.\\n7. Use a spray guard when spraying on the inter-rows of tea. This would prevent excessive spray drift onto peripheral branches and green stems.\\n8. Use diaphragm type lever operated knapsack sprayers which are more appropriate for herbicide applications. All sprayers must be checked for proper performance, and the trigger valves and nozzles need to be checked for leaks.\\n9. Use the correct type of Poly jet flood jet nozzles (yellow: swathe 0.5 m, spray output 0.6 L per minute or green: swathe 1.0 m, spray output 1.2 L per minute).\\n10. Wear protective clothing when mixing and spraying herbicides.\\n11. Clean the tank, nozzle and lance after use thoroughly and wash the self and protective clothing used. Do not throw empty herbicide containers (particularly into streams and waterways).\\n12. Supervise the entire operation carefully to ensure safe and effective weed control.\\n13. Store agro-chemicals separately to prevent mishandling.\\n14. Maintain proper records of purchases, storage, issuance and usage of herbicides.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nelectronic or mechanical, including photocopying, recording, scanning or information storage and retrieval.

Their loppings provide organic matter in large quantities. The organic matter from loppings improves the soil physical properties and also provides nitrogen and other mineral nutrients. Lopping should be carried out at the proper time. The frequency of lopping will depend on the species and the agro-ecological zone in which they are grown.\\n\\n# 2 Loppings of Shade Trees\\n\\n# 2.1\\n\\nMedium shade trees such as Erythrina lithosperma (dadaps) and Gliricidia sepium have a dual purpose in that they afford physical shade to tea and serve as green manure crops. These trees should be lopped 1-3 times a year depending on the growth and weather conditions, with lopping occurring with the onset of rain. Gliricidia could be lopped 2-3 times a year; dadap 1-2 times a year.\\n\\n# 2.2\\n\\nSpecies of Acacia that thrive well in elevations above 1370 m (4500 ft) do not stand up to hard lopping. They should, therefore, be lopped lightly with the commencement of rain.\\n\\n# 2.3\\n\\nCalliandra grows well up to an elevation of 1500 m (5000 ft) and it could be lopped 1-2 times a year; well before pod set.\\n\\n# 2.4\\n\\nLoppings of shade trees should be chopped and spread evenly between tea rows and not heaped up in several places.\\n\\n# 3 Green Manure\\n\\n# 3.1\\n\\nBush varieties like Crotolaria anagyroides or Crotolaria usaromoensis could be grown as green manure crops between every four rows of tea in new clearings. These plants grow fast and attain a height of 1.5 m in 3-4 months. They should be lopped at the time of flowering before pod formation, and the loppings should be spread evenly between tea rows. About 2-3 loppings could be done in a year.\\n\\n# 3.2\\n\\nAs Crotolaria competes with tea for moisture during dry periods, it should be lopped immediately before the onset of drought.\\n\\n# 3.3\\n\\nSesbania sesban is also recommended as a green manure crop for all elevations. This particular species is not a threat to tea as far as tea nematodes are concerned.\\n\\n# 3.4\\n\\nApart from protecting the young tea plants from wind damage, the above green manure species also conserve soil and provide nutrients from their loppings.\\n# The Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\n# Talawakele\\n\\n\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='03036306-5914-49f0-9600-2e23ac00bc4f', embedding=None, metadata={'filename': 'TRI_SI02e.md', 'extension': '.md', 'url': 'https://www.tri.lk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TRI_SI02e.pdf', 'title': 'ADVVISORY CIRCULAR No.SI 925 SHADING IN TEA', 'issue_date': Timestamp('2003-03-01 00:00:00')}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# INSTITUTE\\n\\n# ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.SI 925\\n\\n# Issued in: March 2003\\n\\n# Serial No.3/03\\n\\n# SHADE IN TEA\\n\\n# Objectives\\n\\n(This cancels the Circular No 0-k, Serial No. 5/30, issued in October [9M0)\\n\\n# 1.1\\n\\nPlanting of shade trees has all along been associated with tea cultivation: Shade trees simulate forest conditions, which are believed to be the natural habitat of tea.\\n\\n# 1.2\\n\\nWhen tea is pruned, the bark of the frame that is shaded by the canopy for 3 years can be subjected to sun scorch: In the absence of shade, several pruning cycles aggravate the problem of bark scorching, resulting in a reduction in bud break; prevalent in Uva, and death of the bush during drought: decline in crop. These features are more prevalent in some parts of the mid-country and the low-country.\\n\\n# 1.3\\n\\nShade trees serve other purposes as well. For example, in the low-country, Gliricidia sepium has been found to be a suitable diversionary host to the swarming low-country live wood termite.\\n\\n# Planting; Establishment and Management\\n\\n# 2.1\\n\\nThe establishment of shade should be done early during planting of the rehabilitation. This will ensure that there is adequate shade when the young tea is put out in the field. Shade trees should be planted in the rows where tea is proposed to be planted in order to facilitate easy movement of labour during various cultural operations. In addition, the grass surrounding each shade tree should be trimmed down in order to allow light and prevent smothering by grass.\\n\\n# 2.2\\n\\nIn mature tea, where there is no shade, the best time to plant shade trees is after plucking; the branches of tea bushes surrounding the shade plant should be cut to facilitate their easy establishment. If planted in mature tea, a fence round each plant or by covering with empty fertilizer bags should allow adequate light. In addition, the shade plants should be protected by putting up a fence round each plant.\\n\\n# Establishment of Medium Shade\\n\\n# 3.1\\n\\nCalliandra calothrysus thrives well in elevations between 300 and 1500 m. Calliandra should be established in the following manner: It, however, thrives best at 1300 m.\\nTo establish Calliandra directly in new clearings, 3 to 4 seeds should be sown at one place, on soil mound, where the planting hole is cut to a depth of 45 cm: After the seeds germinate, the seedlings should be thinned down, leaving one vigorous plant to be planted out in the new clearing with the onset of rain.\\n\\nInitial spacing should be 3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft) to enable the plants to give adequate shade for young tea. At the end of 3 years, they should be thinned down to a spacing of 6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft). If more shoots emerge from the base of the plant; they should be thinned out to allow a maximum of three shoots to grow. The first lopping could be carried out 18 - 24 months after planting at a height of 2.3 m (7.5 ft) from ground. Subsequent loppings should be done before the pod set.\\n\\n# 3.2 Dadap (Erythrina lithosperma) and Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium)\\n\\nDadap and Gliricidia are dual-purpose trees, serving as medium shade as well as green manure crops: While Dadap is recommended for elevations above 600 m (2000 ft), Gliricidia could be grown below 900 m (3000 ft).\\n\\nSince propagation by seeds is not practicable, both these species are to be established by planting poles of suitable size and maturity. The poles used for planting should be obtained from healthy mature tree and the trees lopped about 6 - 8 months before poles are cut for planting. The poles should be 6 - 8 months old and have a girth of 5.0 - 7.5 cm (2 - 3 inch) at the time of planting.\\n\\nIn addition, the branches should be ring-barked at least 6 weeks before they are taken at the point of cut. It has been observed that failure in establishment is invariably attributed to the use of over-mature branches: Therefore, use of any over-mature poles from fences, boundaries and senile trees should be avoided.\\n\\nAfter lopping, the poles should be rested vertically against the mother tree, and not left horizontally on the drain or on the ground: transport will reduce the rate of success in establishment. Planting should be done with the onset of monsoon. The height of the stump should be 1.8 - 2.0 m (6 - 7 ft) and the basal end should be buried to a depth of 30 - 40 cm (12 - 15 inch).\\n\\nPrior to planting, both ends should be given a slanting cut by using a sharp knife.\\n# Planting Guidelines\\n\\nPlanting holes should be 30 cm (12 inch) wide and 45-60 cm (18-24\") deep. 225 g (8 oz) dolomite should be mixed with soil while filling the hole. It would be advisable to incorporate kg of compost into each planting hole. The poles should be planted after making an alavangoo hole. The pole should not be rammed into the planting hole, as this will cause damage to its bark. After planting, the soil should be well pressed round the pole. The top end of the pole should be covered with mud or polythene. In order to discourage the lateral sprouting, the poles should be lime washed with a 20% solution of hydrated lime leaving about 30 cm at the top end of the pole.\\n\\n# Lopping Guidelines\\n\\nDadap and Gliricidia withstand lopping well and have good coppicing. The first lopping should be done early to avoid the tree becoming top heavy. The first height of lop should be done at 1.8 m (6 ft) and a crown of branches should be encouraged at the point of 45 of first cut and subsequent cuts. Subsequent loppings should be done at a height of 60 cm (18-24\") above the previous lopping. Gliricidia could be lopped 2-3 times a year in most parts of the mid- and low-country while dadap could be lopped 2 times a year depending on the rate of growth. Loppings should be preferably done with the commencement of monsoon.\\n\\n# Establishment of High Shade\\n\\nGrevillea robusta and Albizzia moluccana or Albizzia chinensis are recommended as high shade tree species. Grevillea robusta can be planted in mid and high elevations while Albizzia moluccana or Albizzia chinensis can be planted in mid and low elevations. Albizzia can, however, be established as an interim high shade, even in the elevation range of 1370-1500 m (4500-5000 ft) with medium shade falling midway between two high shade trees.\\n\\nWhen interplanted with medium shade species, the high shade trees could be planted. The planting holes should be 0.6 m (2.0 ft) deep with a top diameter of 0.3 m (1.0 ft). Dolomite at the rate of 1.0 kg (2.0 lb) could be incorporated into each planting hole. By the third year, high shade should finally be thinned down to a spacing of 12.0 m X 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft) and the medium shade to 6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft). It is preferable to plant the shade trees in the tea row to facilitate easy movement of workers engaged in the various field operations.\\n\\nBoth Grevillea and Albizzia seedlings should initially be raised in poly bags and thereafter planted out in the field with the onset of monsoon.\\n\\n# Management of High Shade\\n\\nIn order to encourage good lateral growth, Grevillea trees could be pollarded at a height of 5 m (15 ft) when they are 10 years old. Albizzia trees should be pollarded when they are over 3 years at a height of 6.0 m (20 ft) and should be pollarded annually. It is necessary to leave at least 3-4 healthy branches below the point of pollarding at different directions; therefore, the height of pollarding may vary accordingly.\\nThe average life span of Grevillea and Albizzia is 30 and 12 years respectively. When the existing Grevillea is 20 years old and Albizzia 8 years, replacements should be established.\\n\\nIt is advisable to plant Albizzia moluccana/Albizzia chienensis around large rock outcrops in the tea field. This will prevent heating up of the rock, which radiates heat and scorches the tea around and also effectively use the space occupied by the rock outcrop.\\n\\nTeas planted in the southern and western slopes of the field experience greater warmth than those on the eastern and northern slopes. Therefore, a denser stand of shade is recommended for southern and western slopes of a field. For this purpose, the final spacing of high shade should be 12.0 m x 6.0 m (40 ft x 20 ft) and that of medium shade 6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft).\\n\\n# 6. Removal of old Shade Trees\\n\\nIn order to ensure that the dead trees do not facilitate root diseases, they should be ring-barked and uprooted along with the tea prior to replanting. However, if Grevillea is under 10 years old or if its girth is below 60 cm (24 inches), it may be retained if there is any bridging up of the gap.\\n\\nThe ring-barked trees, especially Grevillea, should be inspected periodically to check whether new shoots emerging below the point of ring barking should be removed.\\n\\nFelling of shade trees should be done after all the leaves have turned yellow and fallen. It is preferable not to allow the stumps to remain above the soil and any such stumps remaining should be covered with earth after cutting below the soil level.\\n\\nNew shade trees should be planted well before the old ones are removed, so that the field is not left without shade. Ring-barking is not necessary if the roots can be completely removed.\\n\\n# Replacement of Shade trees\\n\\nGenerally, in about 10 years Albizzia and 25 years Grevillea shade trees become unmanageable. Therefore, shade trees should be replaced every 10-25 years depending on the species. At a time when tea is being replanted, young shade trees less than 10 years in age and less than 60 cm (24 inches) girth could be retained.\\n# Shade tree species and planting distances recommended for the different tea growing regions\\n\\n# (a) Up country: Over 1200 m (4000 ft)\\n\\n|Type of shade|Shade tree species|Initial stand|Final stand|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|High shade|Grevillea robusta|6.0 m x 6.0 m (20 ft x 20 ft)|12.0 m x 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft)|\\n|Medium shade|Calliandra calothrysus|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n|Medium shade|Erythrina lithosperma (Dadaps) suitable upto 1500 m (5000 ft)|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n|Medium shade|Acacia pruinosa|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n|Medium shade|Acacia decunens suitable above 1370 m (4500 ft)|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n\\n# (b) Mid-country Wet Zone: 600 - 1200 m (2000 - 4000 ft)\\n\\n|Type of shade|Shade tree species|Initial stand|Final stand|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|High shade|Grevillea robusta|6.0 m x 6.0 m (20 ft x 20 ft)|12.0 m x 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft)|\\n|High shade|Albizzia moluccana|6.0 m x 6.0 m (20 ft x 20 ft)|12.0 m x 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft)|\\n|High shade|Albizzia chinensis|6.0 m x 6.0 m (20 ft x 20 ft)|12.0 m x 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft)|\\n|Medium shade|Calliandra calothrysus|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n|Medium shade|Gliricidia sepium (upto 900 m or 3000 ft)|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n# (c) Mid-country Semi-dry Zone (Uva Region): 600 1800 m (2000 6000 ft)\\n\\n|Type of shade|Shade tree species|Initial stand|Final stand|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|High shade|Grevillea robusta|6.0 m x 6.0 m (20 ft x 20 ft)|12.0 m x 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft)|\\n|High shade|Albizzia moluccana|6.0 m x 6.0 m (20 ft x 20 ft)|12.0 m x 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft)|\\n| |Albizzia chinensis| | |\\n| |(Upto 1370 m or 4500 ft)| | |\\n|Medium shade|Acacia pruinosa|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n|Medium shade|Acacia decurrens|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n| |(suitable above 1370 m or 4500 ft)| | |\\n|Medium shade|Calliandra calothyrsus|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n| |(upto 1500 m or 5000 ft)| | |\\n|Medium shade|Erythrina lithosperma|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n| |(Dadaps, suitable from 900 - 1500 m or 3000 - 5000 ft)| | |\\n|Medium shade|Gliricidia sepium|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n| |(Suitable below 900 m or 3000 ft)| | |\\n\\n# (d) Low country: Below 600 m (2000 ft)\\n\\n|Type of shade|Shade tree species|Initial stand|Final stand|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|High shade|Albizzia moluccana|6.0 m x 6.0 m (20 ft x 20 ft)|12.0 m x 12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft)|\\n| |Albizzia chinensis| | |\\n|Medium shade|Gliricida sepium|3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft)|6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft)|\\n# Fig.1\\n\\nDiagram showing initial and final stands of mixed shade trees\\n\\n|X - Grevillea/Albizzia| | |Dadaps/Gliricida/Calliandra|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Initial stand|36m|356m| |\\n|Final stand|7.2m| |72m1|\\n# The Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\n# Talawakele\\n\\n\\n# \\nAll rights reserved.

T65 MAP (containing mono-ammonium phosphate) and T65 DAP (containing di-ammonium phosphate), are recommended differing only in the source of phosphate. The option to have two P fertiliser sources is to allow the grower to use either source depending on its availability in the market. When both mixtures are available, T65 MAP is preferred as it is easier to handle because it dissolves faster.\\n\\n# 1.1 Composition of nursery mixtures\\n\\n# 1.1.1 T65 MAP\\n\\n|15 parts|Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)|\\n|---|---|\\n|20 parts|Mono-ammonium phosphate (20% N and 35% P2O5)|\\n|15 parts|Sulphate of potash (48% K2O)|\\n|15 parts|Epsom salt (16% MgO)|\\n|65 parts|65 parts|\\n\\nThe mixture contains approximately 10.9% N, 10.8% P2O5, 11.1% K2O and 3.7% MgO.\\n\\n# 1.1.2 T65 DAP\\n\\n|20 parts|Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)|\\n|---|---|\\n|15 parts|Di-ammonium phosphate (18% N, 46% P2O5)|\\n|15 parts|Sulphate of potash (48% K2O)|\\n|15 parts|Epsom salt (16% MgO)|\\n|65 parts|65 parts|\\n\\nThe mixture contains approximately 10.5% N, 10.6% P2O5, 11.1% K2O and 3.7% MgO.\\n\\n# 1.2 Method, dosage and frequency of application\\n\\n# 1.21\\n\\nIn view of the limited solubility of Di-ammonium phosphate in the T85 DAP mixture, the fertiliser should be well ground and made into a paste prior to dissolving it in the required quantity of water. The fertilizer mixture should be applied using watering cans.\\n\\n# 1.22\\n\\nCommencing from the time of rooting (approximately 2 to 3 months after planting of cuttings), apply 35 g of T65 MAP or T65 DAP in 5 liters of water per sq. m. at fortnightly intervals (1 sq. m. would hold approximately 120 nursery plants).\\n# 1.2.3 Growth Progresses\\n\\n(approximately 5 to 6 months after planting of cuttings): Increase the dosage to 70 g in 5 liters of water per sq. m. at fortnightly intervals as\\n\\n# 1.2.4\\n\\nFollowing each application, wash the foliage with clean water, to avoid scorch of leaves.\\n\\n# 1.3 Estimation of T65 Requirements\\n\\nAt the above rates of application, the quantity of T65 MAP or T65 DAP required to raise 10,000 plants is estimated to be 60 to 90 kg, depending on the length of the nursery period in different regions. An approximate estimate of the quantity of the mixture required to raise 10,000 plants for low, mid- and up country is given below:\\n\\n|Length of nursery period (months)|Quantity (kg)| |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Low country|8 to 10|60 to 80|\\n|Mid-country|8 to 10|60 to 80|\\n|Up country|10 to 12|80 to 90|\\n\\n# 1.4 Foliar Application of Zinc Sulphate\\n\\nFoliar application of zinc sulphate is recommended to induce bud break and activate the growth of nursery plants.\\n\\n# 1.4.1 Dosage and Frequency of Application\\n\\nAbout a week after the first application of T65, spray 14 g of zinc sulphate in 4.5 liters of water to wet approximately 4500 plants, using knapsack sprayers: Repeat application at 4 to 6 weeks intervals, up to a maximum of 4 applications.\\n\\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

There should be an interval of 4 to 6 weeks between the ground fertiliser application and dolomite application.\\n# 2.2 Mixture TzO0\\n\\n# 2.21 Composition\\n\\n|100 parts|Sulphate of ammonia|(20.6% N)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|50 parts|Eppawela rock phosphate| |\\n|25 parts|Muriate of potash|(28.5% PzOs)|\\n|25 parts| |(60% KzO)|\\n|25 parts|Kieserite|(24% MgO)|\\n|200 parts| | |\\n\\nThe mixture contains approximately 10.3% N, 6.9% PzOs, 7.5% KzO and 3.0% MgO\\n\\n# 2.2.2 Dosage and frequency of application\\n\\nApproximately two months after planting; apply T200 at the rates of 15 or 21 g per plant per application six or four times in the 1st year, and 21 or 32 g per plant per application six or four times in the 2nd year:\\n\\n# 2.2.3 Estimation of T200 requirements\\n\\nAt the above rates of application, the quantities of T200 mixture required per ha (12,500 plants) are approximately:\\n\\n- 1100 kg in the 1st year; and\\n- 1600 kg in the 2nd year\\n\\nThe quantities of nutrients supplied in the 1st and 2nd year are given below:\\n\\n|Amount of T200 per plant per application|Number of applications per year|Approximate quantities of nutrients, kg per ha per year| | | | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|15 g|113|N|76|PzOs|83|KzO|33|MgO|\\n|21 g|165|N|110|PzOs|120|KzO|48|MgO|\\n\\n# 2.2.4 Time of application\\n\\nWhere favourable weather conditions prevail, frequent applications of fertiliser are ie. six doses per year. In areas with prolonged dry periods, four doses per year may be possible. Application of fertiliser in relation to weather is important. If it is applied during periods of heavy rain, there is a possibility of it being washed away, particularly if the land is exposed. Fertiliser application during long periods of dry weather should be avoided to prevent scorch or even death of young plants.\\n# 2.2.5 Method of application\\n\\nIn the early stages, fertiliser should be applied in a ring round the plant, at a radius of 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8\"). Care should be taken not to apply fertiliser too close to the base of the plant as this would result in bark scorch. In steep areas, fertiliser should be applied in a semi-circle on the upper slopes. Fertiliser should be dibbled into the soil to a depth not exceeding 7.5 cm (3\").\\n\\n# 2.3 Foliar applications\\n\\nFoliar applications of fertiliser should be made with knapsack sprayers.\\n\\n# 2.3.1 Zinc sulphate\\n\\nZinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 4 to 6 kg per ha per year; in four to six applications in the 1st year; i.e. 14 days after ground fertiliser application. The quantity of ZnSO4 and water should be doubled for each of the four to six applications in the 2nd year; i.e. 2 kg in 200 l of water per ha per application.\\n\\n# 2.3.2 Nitrogen and magnesium\\n\\nIf deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) and/or magnesium (interveinal chlorosis in lower maintenance foliage) are observed, apply 1 to 2% of urea and/or 1 to 2% of commercial Epsom salt. Apply 1 to 2 kg of urea and 1 to 2 kg of commercial Epsom salt per ha in 100 l of water in the 1st year, and 2 to 4 kg of each per ha in 200 l in the 2nd year; as and when necessary. Zinc sulphate, urea and commercial Epsom salt can be mixed together and applied as a single foliar spray, when required. However, do not exceed 5% total salt concentration in the final spray solution. (N.B. Zinc sulphate and Epsom salt are both salts.)\\n\\n# 2.3.3 Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects\\n\\nSulphate of potash is recommended for application prior to dry spells. A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 2 kg in 100 l of water) is recommended at fortnightly intervals, at least a month prior to the onset of the dry period. Urea (2%) may be included in the spray solution to enhance absorption of potassium. No benefits could result from this foliar spray, if carried out after dry weather has set in. Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.\\n# Application from commencement of plucking to the Ist prune\\n\\n# 3.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone\\n\\nCheck the soil pH when the tea is brought into bearing. If the pH is below 4.5, apply 750 kg of dolomite per ha: application should be carried out at the time of the Ist prune, preferably a few weeks before pruning.\\n\\n# 3.2 Mixture T750\\n\\n# 3.2.1 Composition\\n\\n|500 parts|Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)|\\n|---|---|\\n|100 parts|Eppawela rock phosphate|\\n|100 parts|Muriate of potash (28.5% P2O5)|\\n|100 parts|(60% K2O)|\\n|50 parts|Kieserite (24% MgO)|\\n|750 parts| |\\n\\nThe mixture contains approximately 13.7% N, 3.7% P2O5, 8.0% K2O and 1.6% MgO.\\n\\n# 3.2.2 Dosage and frequency of application\\n\\nApply T750 at the rate of 1,750 kg per ha per year from the 3rd year onwards until the Ist prune, in four or more applications.\\n\\nThe quantities of nutrients supplied are:\\n\\n|Nutrient (kg per ha per year)|N|P2O5|K2O|MgO|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |240|65|140|28|\\n\\n# 3.2.3 Method of application\\n\\nAt the end of 2 to 3 years, the tea should normally have been brought into plucking and should by then form a good cover: The fertiliser could therefore be broadcast.\\n\\n# 3.3 Foliar applications\\n\\n# 3.3.1 Zinc sulphate\\n\\nZinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 6 to 9 kg per ha per year until the 1st prune: It can be applied in four to six applications, at 1.5 kg in 300 to 400 liters of water per ha per application, within 7 - 14 days after ground fertiliser application.\\n# 3.3.2 Nitrogen and magnesium\\n\\nIf deficiency of nitrogen (general yellowing) and magnesium (interveinal chlorosis in lower maintenance foliage) are observed, apply 2 to 4% of urea and 2 to 4% commercial Epsom salt at the rate of 8 to 12 kg of each per ha in 300 to 400 liters of water until the 15 prune, as and when necessary. The quantity of urea and commercial Epsom salt could be adjusted depending on the severity of deficiency symptoms.

Introduction\\n\\nBalanced nutrition plays a key role in the maintenance of tea plantations. The cost of fertiliser application varies from 6 to 12% of the total cost of production. Hence, cost-effective investment in fertiliser is necessary to manage a plantation as a commercially viable enterprise.\\n\\nThe response of the tea plant to NPK fertilisers is influenced by several factors such as climate, soil, plant and cultural practices. These factors vary widely between tea growing regions and therefore the plant response to fertiliser is different in different mature tea growing regions. In the present fertiliser recommendations, regional differences have been taken into consideration in order to optimise productivity and profitability of the land.\\n\\n# 2.0 Amelioration of soil pH in mature tea fields\\n\\nThe maintenance of suitable soil pH levels is an important practice in soil fertility management.\\n\\n# 2.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone\\n\\nApplication of dolomitic limestone is recommended to maintain soil pH between 4.5 and 5.5. The rates of dolomite indicated below should be applied depending on pH level, preferably a few weeks before pruning. The soil pH should be checked prior to every prune.\\n# Soil pH\\n\\n|Soil pH|Dolomite (kg/ha)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Below 3.9|2500|\\n|From 3.9 up to 4.2|2000|\\n|From 4.2 up to 4.5|1500|\\n|Above 4.5|1000|\\n\\n# 21.1 Specifications\\n\\nThe dolomitic limestone must have a minimum of 18% MgO, and approximately 100% of particles passing through 30 mesh, and 40 to 60% of particles passing through 100 mesh:\\n\\n# Plant Response to ground applied nutrients\\n\\nThe optimum range of N; P and K nutrients (kg/ha/yr) required by seedling and VP teas for maximum yield response in different tea growing regions are given in Table 1.\\n\\n# Table 1 - N, P and K requirements for seedling and VP tea in different tea growing regions\\n\\n| |Up country|Mid-country|Low country|Uva| |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Seedling tea|N|90|180|90|220|\\n| |P2O5|25|25|25|25|\\n| |K2O|70|70|50|100|\\n|VP tea|N|270|400|270|400|\\n| |P2O5| |35| |35|\\n| |K2O|100|140|100|140|\\n\\n# 3.1 Basal mixtures\\n\\nTo supply the required nutrients, three basal mixtures have been formulated separately for seedling and VP tea: The designation of each mixture identifies the type of tea and the region:\\n\\n# 3.1.1 Designation\\n\\n- STIUM - Seedling tea mixture for low country\\n- STILC - Seedling tea mixture for up and mid-country\\n- STIUVA - Seedling tea mixture for Uva\\n- VPIUM - Mature VP tea mixture for up and mid-country\\n- VPILC - Mature VP tea mixture for low country\\n- VPIUVA - Mature VP tea mixture for Uva\\n# 3.1.2 Composition\\n\\n# Seedling tea mixtures:\\n\\n| |STIUM|STILC|STIUVA|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Urea parts|196 (90 N)|196 (90 N)|196 (90 N) 89 (25 PzOs)|\\n|ERP parts|87 (25 PzOs)|86 (25 PzOs)| |\\n|MOP parts|117 (70 KzO)|83 (50 KzO)|150 (90 KzO)|\\n| |40Q|365|435|\\n\\nThe seedling tea mixtures contain approximately: 22.5% N, 6.2% PzOs and 17.6% KzO\\n\\nSTIUM 400\\n\\nSTILC 365 24.7% N, 6.7% PzOs and 13.6% KzO\\n\\nSTIUVA 435 20.7% N, 5.8% PzOs and 20.7% KzO\\n\\n# VP tea mixtures:\\n\\n| |VPIUM|VPILC|VPIUVA|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Urea parts|587 (270 N)|587 (270 N)|587 (270 N)|\\n|ERP parts|123 (35 PzOs)|126 (35 PzOs)|125 (35 PzOs)|\\n|MOP parts|200 (120 KzO)|16Z (100 KzO)|233 (140 KzO)|\\n| |910|88Q|945|\\n\\nThe VP mixtures contain approximately:\\n\\nVPIUM 910 29.7% N, 3.9% PzOs and 13.2% KzO\\n\\nVPILC 880 30.79 N, 4.1% PzOs and 11.4% Kzo\\n\\nVPIUVA 945 28.6% N, 3.8% PzOs and 14.8% KzO\\n\\n# 3.2 Fertiliser applications based on \"potential yield\"\\n\\nCalculation of annual N-fertiliser requirement for yield may be defined as the highest yield given tea field is based on \"potential yield\". The annual potential achieved in the particular year of the pruning cycle, based on the immediate past three cycles.\\n\\nThe application of fertiliser to mature seedling or VP fields should be based on such calculated potential yields. The method of calculation of potential yield for every 12-month period from prune is given below:\\n\\nTabulate the annual yield data of each field (kg made tea per ha per year) over the previous 3 cycles (15 years, if the cycle has 5 years): However, if data is not available for three cycles, the data of the past two cycles may be used:\\nAn example is given in Table 2.\\n\\n# Table 2\\n\\nYield record of 12-month periods from pruning (kg made tea per year)\\n\\n|Cycle|1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|1st|1037|2053|1941|1708|926|\\n|2nd|884|1893|1826|1573|866|\\n|3rd|990|2140|2090|1650|895|\\n\\nThe highest achieved yield (potential yield) for the given year in the cycle is 1037, 2140, 2090, 1708 and 926 for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th year, respectively.\\n\\nSelect the N-level corresponding to each of the potential yields from Table 3.\\n\\n# Table 3\\n\\nAnnual requirement of nitrogen for the potential yield\\n\\n|Potential yield (kg made tea per ha per year)|Requirement of nitrogen (kg N per ha per year)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Less than 900|90|\\n|900-1300|140|\\n|1300-1500|160|\\n|1500-1700|180|\\n|1700-1900|200|\\n|1900-2000|220|\\n|2000-2500|270|\\n|2500-3000|320|\\n|3000-3500|360|\\n|Above 3500|400|\\n\\nThe quantity of nitrogen to be applied in the respective years is therefore:\\n\\n| |1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|12 months|1037|2140|2090|1708|926|\\n|N to be applied (kg per ha per year)|140|270|270|200|140|\\n\\nOnce the quantity of nitrogen per ha per year is determined for each field, the quantity per application is calculated according to the number of applications that is practically possible. The number of applications should be determined on the basis of the agro-climatic conditions, as well as on the cropping pattern of the relevant region.\\n# 3.3 Quantity of nutrients, basal mixture and urea, application frequencies and dosages\\n\\nThe quantities of nutrients required, inclusive of the basal mixture and urea, and the applicable frequencies and dosages corresponding to the potential yield category for seedling and VP teas, are given in Tables 4 and 5.\\n\\n# 3.4 Foliar and other ground fertiliser applications\\n\\nFoliar applications of fertiliser for mature tea should be made with knapsack sprayers:\\n\\n# 3.4.1 Zinc sulphate\\n\\nZinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 6 and 11 kg per ha per year, for fields yielding less than, and above, 2000 made tea kg per ha per year, respectively. This should be done in four applications, i.e: 1.5 and 2.75 kg in 400 ha per application. Zinc sulphate should be applied within 7 days after ground fertiliser application:\\n\\n# 3.4.2 Other nutrients\\n\\nIf deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) are observed, apply 2 to 4% of urea: Apply 8 to 16 kg of urea per ha in 400 litres of water, as and when necessary. If deficiency symptoms of manganese (interveinal chlorosis and reddish brown necrotic spots on leaf blade) are observed, test the soil pH. If it is above 5.5, apply 2% manganese sulphate until symptoms disappear, preferably at 3 to 4 week intervals: In addition, withhold the scheduled application of dolomite.\\n\\n# 3.4.3 Epsom salt and kieserite for correcting magnesium deficiency\\n\\nWhen magnesium deficiency symptoms are observed, spray commercial Epsom salt initially, at the rate of 48 kg per ha per year in four applications, at intervals of three months. Commercial Epsom salt, zinc sulphate and urea can be mixed together and applied as a single foliar spray, when required: The quantity of urea and Epsom salt could be adjusted depending on the severity of deficiency symptoms. However, do not exceed 5% total salt concentration in the final spray solution. (NB: Zinc sulphate and Epsom salt are both salts.) After application of the above, test the soil for Mg content: If it is below the critical level (60 ppm): apply kieserite at the rate of 125 kg per ha per year by mixing with basal NPK mixture or with urea in situ.\\n|Region|Potential yield (kg/ha/yr)|Recommended N quantity of K2O P2O5|Quantity and source of N (kg/ha) and number of applications|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Up Country|900|90 : 25 : 70|90 kg N as STIUM 2 x 200 kg STIUM|\\n| |1300|140 : 25 : 70|90 kg N as STIUM & 50 kg N as urea 1 x 110 kg urea|\\n| |1500|160 : 25 : 70|90 kg N as STIUM & 70 kg N as urea 2 x 200 kg STIUM 1 x 150 kg urea|\\n| |1500 - 1700|180 : 25 : 70|90 kg N as STIUM & 90 kg N as urea (2 applications possible with care) 1 x 200 kg urea|\\n| |1700 - 1900|200 : 25 : 70|90 kg N as STIUM & 110 kg N as urea 2 x 200 kg STIUM 1 x 110 & 1 x 130 kg urea|\\n| |Above 1900|220 : 25 : 70|90 kg N as STIUM & 130 kg N as urea 2 x 200 kg STIUM 2 x 140 kg urea|\\n|Mid (Wet Zone)|Same as 1 to 4 above| | |\\n|Low Country|900|90 : 25 : 50|90 kg N as STILC 2 x 180 kg STILC|\\n| |Above 900|50|90 kg N as STILC & 50 kg N as urea 2 x 180 kg STILC 1 x 110 kg urea|\\n|Uva|<900|90 : 25 : 90|90 kg N as STIUVA 2 x 220 kg STIUVA|\\n| |900|1300|140 : 25 : 90 90 kg N as STIUVA & 50 kg N as urea 2 x 220 kg STIUVA 1 x 110 kg urea|\\n| |1300|1500|160 : 25 : 90 90 kg N as STIUVA & 70 kg N as urea 2 x 220 kg STIUVA 1 x 150 kg urea|\\n| |1500|1700|180 : 25 : 90 90 kg N as STIUVA & 90 kg N as urea (2 applications possible with care) 1 x 200 kg urea|\\n| |1700|1900|200 : 25 : 90 90 kg N as STIUVA & 110 kg N as urea 2 x 220 kg STIUVA 1 x 110 & 1 x 130 kg urea (50 and 60 kg N respectively)|\\n| |Above 1900|220 : 25 : 90|90 kg N as STIUVA & 130 kg N as urea 2 x 220 kg STIUVA 2 x 140 kg urea|\\n|Region|Potential yield (kglhalyr)|Recommended quantity of N (kg P2O5 K2O)|Quantity and source of N|No: of applications and quantity per application (kglha)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Up country|1. 2000|2500|270 : 35 : 120|270 kg N as VPIUM 4x230 kg VPIUM|\\n|2|2500 - 3000|320|270 kg N as VPIUM & 50 kg N as urea|4X230 kg VPIUM 1x110 kg urea|\\n|3.|3000 - 3500|360|270 kg N as VPIUM & 90 kg N as urea|4x230 kg VPIUM 1 x200 kg urea (2 applications possible with care)|\\n|Above 3500|400|35|270 kg N as VPIUM & 130 kg N as urea|4 x230 kg VPIUM 2X 140 kg urea|\\n|Mid-country (Wet Zone)|Same as 1 to 4 above| | | |\\n|Low Country|1. 2000|2500|270 35 : 100|270 kg N as VPILC 3 x 290 kg VPILC|\\n|2.|2500 - 3000|320|270 kg N as VPILC & 50 kg N as urea|3 x290 kg VPILC 1x110 kg urea|\\n|3.|3000 - 3500|360|270 kg N as VPILC & 90 kg N as urea|3 x 290 kg VPILC 1 x 200 kg urea (2 applications possible with care)|\\n|Above 3500|400|35|270 kg N as VPILC & 130 kg N as urea|3x290 kg VPILC 2X 140 kg urea|\\n|Uva|1. 2000|2500|270 : 35 : 140|270 kg N as VPIUVA 3 X 315 kg VPIUVA|\\n|2.|2500 - 3000|320|270 kg N as VPIUVA & 50 kg N as urea|3 x 315 kg VPIUVA 1x110 kg urea|\\n|3.|3000 - 3500|360|270 kg N as VPIUVA & 90 kg N as urea|1x200 kg Urea (2 applications possible with care)|\\n|4.|Above 3500|400|270 kg N as VPIUVA 130 kg N as urea|3 X 315 kg VPIUVA 2X140 kg urea|\\n\\nNote: 1. proportionately: For fields yielding below 2000 kg per ha per year; the nitrogen level may be reduced. The quantity per application may be adjusted to suit the seasonal variation in yield as well as age from pruning. Where the bulk is large, the number of applications may be increased: Urea could be bulked with the basal mixture.\\n# 3.4.4 Soil application of boron\\n\\nSoil application of boron is recommended at the rate of 4.5 kg per ha per year. When symptoms of boron deficiency are observed in shade trees, borate (borax) should be mixed with basal NPK mixture or urea in situ:\\n\\n# 3.4.5 Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects\\n\\nSulphate of potash is recommended for mature tea, to be applied prior to an anticipated drought and in areas that are prone to frequent drought damage.

Introduction\\n\\nNutrient status of soil can be determined by soil analysis. The corrective measures to amend or improve nutrient deficiencies can be based on results of such analysis. However; soil analysis only may not be adequate to make recommendations as there are several other factors that govern the availability of nutrients.\\n\\nSoil analysis may be resorted to, when it is suspected that the soil is the primary cause for poor performance of tea bushes. Other factors such as fertilizer application, cultural practices, etc. should have been correctly adhered to. Under such circumstances, a complete analysis of soil is likely to reveal the factor which causes poor growth.\\n\\nFor Site Specific Fertilizer Recommendation (SSFR), soil analyses are compulsory because SSFR mainly depends on soil nutrient status.\\n\\nFor soil analysis to be reliable for decision making; soil should have been sampled correctly: Therefore, due regard must be paid to the sampling procedure outlined below:\\n\\n# 2. Sampling for nutrient analysis\\n\\nThe collection, preparation and delivery of a soil sample are important steps in the analytical operation.\\n\\n# 2.1 Time of sampling\\n\\nFor the estimation of soil pH levels and/or nutrient status, sampling should be carried out after a minimum period of 6 weeks following the last ground fertilizer application. At the time of sampling, soil should be relatively moist. Sampling should be avoided during severe drought and heavy rainfall seasons. In the case of SSFR, representative soil samples should be obtained annually to determine the nutrient status. Samples for SSFR can be obtained during March/April and September/October from the South-West quarter; and during September/October from the North-East quarter.\\n\\n# 2.2 Tools and the procedure\\n\\nThe ordinary post-hole auger is the best sampling tool. Its combined cutting and digging edge makes it most serviceable for general use even on hard ground. The stem should be marked at intervals of 15 cm (6 inches) so that the depth of sampling can be ascertained at a glance. Except in gravelly areas, it is possible to sample up to a depth of 60 cm (24 inches) with the above soil auger; if necessary. As an alternative, the alavangoe normally used for digging planting holes is satisfactory for the purpose. For collecting soil from depths below the reach of the soil auger; it is necessary to dig pits. For diagnostic purposes, sampling to a depth of 15 cm (6 inches) would be sufficient. The leaf litter on the soil surface (not incorporated in the soil).\\n# 2.3 Technique of sampling\\n\\nOne of the most important aspects of soil testing is the technique of obtaining a soil sample that is representative of the area. The errors in sampling a field are generally greater than the errors in laboratory analysis. The size of the area from which one sample may be taken varies greatly; but usually ranges from 2 to 10 hectares (5 to 25 acres). A field may be marked into blocks depending on the area, topography, drainage, past cultural practices, etc. Areas that vary in appearance, slope, drainage, soil-type should be sampled separately (Figure 1). Localized areas with extremely poor soil or crop growth should be marked separately and sampled:\\n\\nLevel land\\n\\nVery steep slope\\n\\nDrain\\n\\nSteep slope\\n\\nGentle slope\\n\\nBottom Land\\n\\nDrain\\n\\nFigure 1. Demarcation of an area into blocks to obtain representative soil samples of the area (numbers within the circulars are blocks).\\n\\n# 2.4 Number of samples\\n\\nUsing the auger; a large number of core samples should be collected randomly in a zigzag manner as shown in Figure 2. It is advisable to take cores from points closer to the plants where root activity is high, rather than the middle of the rows. Sampling should not be done near roads, paths, drains or other non-representative or abnormal areas. The number of soil cores to be taken would depend on the area which the composite soil sample is expected to represent: Each sample should contain soil from cores taken at several places in the field. This procedure is to maximize the influence of uniformity in the soil sample. From small or experimental plots, it would suffice to take about 10 cores. When sampling a large field, it should first be divided into blocks of about 2 hectares (5 acres) and 15 to 20 cores should be taken from each block;\\n\\nThe soil cores from each block should be collected on an aluminium/plastic tray or a piece of polythene sheet or brown paper. When soil is collected for trace element analyses, the tray should be lined with a polythene sheet.\\n# Figure 2. Soil sampling in a zigzag random manner to obtain a composite sample\\n\\nThe soil should be thoroughly mixed, breaking-up any lumps and spread into a layer. Small portions from the layers are taken at random and transferred into a clean polythene bag in order to provide a sub-sample of about ½ kilogram (1 lb). The bag should be closed immediately by tying and labelled with a waterproof marking pen, giving details of location (estate, field and block), depth of sample, date etc. The samples should then be despatched to the laboratory without undue delay.\\n\\n# 3. Sample despatch\\n\\nThe samples should be sent directly to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories located at the following addresses depending on the convenience for transport:\\n\\n- Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Walahanduwa, Galle\\n- Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Research, Advisory and Extension Centre, PO Box, 130, Hantana, Kandy\\n\\nIt is necessary that the total cost of analysis should be paid prior to commencing analysis. Payments could be made through cheques, postal or money orders drawn in favour of \"Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\" and forwarded to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division; Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka; Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories at Hantana, Kandy and Walahanduwa, Galle. Money could also be paid at the cash counter of the Tea Research Institute or its centres at the time of submission of samples for analysis.\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

Adulteration\\n2. Presence of excess moisture. Straight fertilizers or fertilizer mixtures which are hygroscopic or contain hygroscopic components, could absorb moisture and become a slurry; if stored under humid conditions\\n3. Inadequate mixing of the components of a fertilizer mixture\\n4. Segregation of particles of different sizes in the bag containing the mixture during transport and storage\\n5. Presence of impurities\\n6. Incorrect sampling procedure\\n7. Analytical errors This is relatively small\\n\\nFor the results of analysis to be meaningful, it is necessary that great care be taken when sampling is carried out. It is only then the samples would be representative of the bulk of the fertilizer or fertilizer-mixture sampled. Thus, it is important that the following procedure be strictly adhered to in sampling.\\n\\n# Sampling\\n\\nThe number of fertilizer bags to be collected at random for sampling should be determined based on the amount of fertilizer bags in a given store as per Table.\\n\\n|Stock of fertilizer|Percentage of the minimum number of bags taken for sampling|Number of bags|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Less than 2 bags|100|sample both bags|\\n|2-5 bags|60| |\\n|6-10 bags|40|3|\\n|11-20 bags|20|3|\\n|21-60 bags| |2|\\n|61-200 bags|4|3|\\n|201-500 bags|3|8|\\n|501-1000 bags|2|13|\\n|1001 or more bags| |20|\\n# The accepted procedure for obtaining a representative sample of fertilizer is described below:\\n\\n# 3. Methods of sampling\\n\\n# 3.1 Use of a shovel\\n\\nThe bags to be sampled should be selected at random and should be emptied separately on a clean dry surface and blended using a shovel and one shovelful taken from each: The shovelfuls so taken should be then thoroughly mixed and any lumps broken up. From this mixture; a sub sample should be drawn by the process of quartering:\\n\\n# 3.2 Use of a sampling probe\\n\\nUse a sampling probe (details given below) to draw samples from fertilizer bags:\\n\\n1. Lay bags horizontally; open one end and pass the probe diagonally from one end to the other and remove the core.\\n2. From lots of ten bags, take one core from each bag.\\n3. For lots of more than ten bags, select ten bags at random and then take one core from each bag.\\n4. When it is necessary to sample only lots of less than ten bags, take ten cores but at least one core from each of the bags.\\n5. For bulk fertilizer, draw at least ten cores from different points. From this, subsamples should be drawn by the process of quartering as described below.\\n\\nThe sampling probe could be constructed by taking 0.9 m (3 feet) long 5 cm (2 inches) internal diameter conduit piping or PVC tubing: Cut one end of the tubing obliquely to get sharp pointed edge (Figure 1).\\n\\nFigure 1. A diagramatic sketch of a sampling probe (a) and a shovel (b)\\n\\n# Subsampling by the process of quartering\\n\\nIt is required to reduce the quantity of fertilizer to a manageable size prior to submission for analysis. Therefore quartering should be adopted as explained below to subsample the collected fertilizer (Figure 2).\\n\\n1. Heap the fertilizer to form a \"cone\" on a clean sheet of paper or polythene.\\n2. Flatten the cone and divide into two sections through the centre with a metal spatula or wooden plank.\\n3. Divide each half once more and separate the four quarters into four separate piles or quarters.\\n4. Reject one set of diagonally opposite quarters and mix the remainder.\\n5. Continue the quartering and rejection until the desired quantity of sub sample is obtained.\\n6. Collect the final remainder as representative sub sample.\\n\\nOne kilogram of sub sample is quite sufficient; of which only one-third need be sent for nutrient analysis, one-third should be sent to the supplier and the balance must be retained by the customer.\\n# 5. Labelling\\n\\nThe samples should be carefully and correctly labelled giving the name of the estate, type of fertilizer and the date on which the samples was taken. It must be ensured that the label does not come into contact with the fertilizer sample. This precaution is taken to avoid the labels becoming illegible at the time of arrival at the TRI laboratories or its centres.\\n\\n# 6. Sample despatch\\n\\nThe samples should be sent directly to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories located at following addresses depending on convenience for transport:\\n\\nSoils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Walahanduwa, GalleSoils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Research, Advisory and Extension Centre, PO Box, 130, Hantana, Kandy\\nIt is necessary that the total cost of analysis should be paid prior to commencing analysis.

They extract their nutrient requirements from the soil and for healthy growth, the important nutrients should be freely available in the right proportions. Either a deficiency or an excess of any one or more of the nutrients can have a profound influence on the healthy growth of the plant. A nutrient deficiency or excess will in the first instance, show up in the foliage of the plants as distinct and characteristic symptoms. Chemical analysis of the foliage of the plants would, therefore, serve to confirm the visual observations and also give a reasonably good index of their nutrient status.\\n\\nIf tea growers strictly follow the fertilizer recommendations of the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka; the need for routine analysis would not arise. Foliar analysis is, however, recommended in instances where growth abnormalities are suspected to be due to nutritional problems.\\n\\n# 1. Leaf sampling\\n\\nFor most leaf analysis, it is the first mature leaf (Figure 1) that is collected and it is from the axil of this leaf that the pluckable shoot emerges. This is usually found on the plucking table, whilst those below; and consequently shaded should be avoided. When sampling an experimental plot; one or two leaves are taken from each bush in the plot to provide a composite sample of about 100 leaves.\\n\\n1. When sampling is carried out on field scale, a large number of widely distributed bushes should be sampled, taking one leaf from each bush.\\n2. In order to get a representative sample; it is preferable to randomly select bushes from different rows.\\n3. Bushes growing in abnormal areas such as close to roads and drains and those in bare patches should be avoided.\\n4. It is best to avoid collecting leaf samples following a period of prolonged heavy rainfall or during extreme droughts.\\n\\n# 2. Sampling and packing procedure of leaf samples\\n\\nLeaf sampling should be avoided in the early part of the pruning cycle. Under low country conditions where certain fields are maintained on a 2 year cycle, sampling should be done in the 2nd half of the first year or 1st half of the 2nd year.\\n\\n1. It is absolutely essential to note that sampling should be done only after a minimum period of 6 weeks following the last ground application of fertilizer.\\n2. From each block of 2 ha, collect about 100 leaves at random selecting only the first mature leaf at the plucking table (Figure 1).\\n3. Do not collect more than one leaf per bush.\\n# Bud\\n\\n# First leaf\\n\\n# Second leaf\\n\\n# Flush\\n\\n# Third leaf\\n\\n# Fish leaf\\n\\n# Scale leaf\\n\\n# First mature leaf\\n\\n# Figure\\n\\nDiagrammatic sketch of shoot showing leaf to be sampled\\n\\nPack the samples in polythene bags. Label each sample clearly and ensure that the label is not in contact with the sample: This precaution is taken to avoid the labels becoming illegible at the time of arrival at the TRI laboratories or its centres. The labels should contain details of the field and the block number; fertilizer application year of last prune, length of the pruning cycle and the date of the last seedling or VP tea.\\n\\n# Sample despatch\\n\\nThe samples should be sent directly to the Head; Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories located at following addresses depending on the convenience for transport:\\n\\n- Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Walahanduwa, Galle\\n- Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory; Research, Advisory and Extension Centre, PO Box, 130, Hantana, Kandy\\n\\nIt is necessary that the total cost of analysis should be paid prior to commencing analysis.

This leads to poor use efficiency of soil applied fertilizers in these regions. Recent assessments done in small holder lands in these regions revealed that soil magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S) levels are also significantly low.\\n\\nApplications of mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as Urea, Eppawela rock phosphate and Muriate of potash respectively, are recommended for mature tea fields in 2 to 5 splits per annum. The annual requirement of N is based on the potential yield recommended quantity of dolomite (MgCO3CaCO3) for pH correction at the time of pruning: The recommended quantity of dolomite is to be based on soil pH level in the latter part of the last year of cycle. Dolomite should comply with the specifications given in the TRI Advisory Circular SP3.\\n\\nEven though dolomite is applied, low nutrient retention capacities of soils may not make Mg available for plants throughout the pruning cycle. Furthermore, Mg deficiency could also be induced due to suppression of its uptake by the applications of higher rates of N and K containing fertilizers. These circumstances invariably lead to lack of Mg in soil and affecting healthy plant growth.\\n\\nIn view of above observations, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 were formulated as strategic interventions to improve soil fertility status in the tea small holdings. The suitability of new mixtures were tested in 26 small holder lands along with the other fertilizer mixtures previously recommended by the TRI, covering different Agro-ecological regions in major tea growing areas.\\n\\nBased on the outcomes of adaptive trials, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 are recommended for small holdings in all the tea growing regions in addition to previously recommended fertilizer mixtures for mature VP tea fields in different tea growing regions viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VPIUM 910 and VPIUM 1020 for mid & up country and VPIUva 945 and VPIUva 1055 for the Uva region.\\n\\n|Fertilizer Mixtures|Tea Growing Regions|\\n|---|---|\\n|U834|All Regions|\\n|UT752|All Regions|\\n|VPILC 880|Low Country|\\n|VPILC 1075|Low Country|\\n|VPIUM 910|Mid & Up Country|\\n|VPIUM 1020|Mid & Up Country|\\n|VPIUva 945|Uva Region|\\n|VPIUva 1055|Uva Region|\\nGrowers may select the mixtures to be used primarily based on the soil nutrient status, yield or crop responses. It is advisable to use either UT 752 mixture with 100 kg of dolomite per acre per annum or U 834 mixture if soil Mg and/or S levels are below 60 and 40 milligrams per kilogram (ppm) respectively in all the tea growing regions. However, if soil Mg level is above 60 ppm and S level above 40 ppm, it is appropriate to use regional specific mixtures viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VPMUM 1020 for mid and up country and VPUva 945 and VPMUva 1055 for Uva region.\\n\\n# 1.

Also this cancels Advisory Circulars WM 2 and WM 3 Serial Nos. 10/03 and 11/03, issued in July and September 2003 respectively)\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nWeeds are any plants that grow where they are unwanted or out of place and they interfere with tea grower\\'s objectives. There are different types of weed species, in tea fields. The weed species present in tea lands are summarized in Table 1 based on their morphological classifications:\\n\\n|Broad leaf|Ageratum conyzoides (Hulanthala), Asystasia gangetica (Puruk-kola), Bidens pilosa (Ottu-pillu), Caladium bicolor (Mal Habarala), Commelina diffusa (Gira-pala), Crassocephalum crepidioides (Thandum-pillu), Erigeron sumatrensis (Alawungu-pillu), Lantana camara (Ganda-pana), Leucas zeylanica (Geta-tumba), Miconia crenata (Wal-Bovitiya), Osbeckia octandra (Heen-bowitiya), Persicaria capitata (Ratu kimbulwenna), Phyllanthus debilis (Ela pitawakka), Scoparia dulcis (Wal-koththamalli), Sida acuta (Gas-bebila), Solanum americanum (Kalu kun-berriya), Spermacoce ocymifolia (Geta-kola), Sphagneticola trilobata (Arunadevi) etc.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Grasses|Cenchrus setosus (Nari naguta), Chrysopogon aciculatus (Thuththiri), Digitaria abyssinica (Heen Etawara), Eleusine indica (Belathana), Imperata cylindrica (Illuk), Megathyrsus maximus (Gini-thana), Panicum repens (Etora), Panicum trichocladum (Kambi-thankola), Setaria barbata (Wal thal kola) etc.|\\n|Sedges|Bulbostylis barbata (Uru-Hiri), Cyperus aromaticus, Cyperus brevifolius, Cyperus mindorensis (Mottu Thana), Cyperus rotundus (Kalanduru), Cyperus sesquiflorus, Fimbristylis sp. etc.|\\n\\nWeeds in tea lands could interfere with the growth of tea by competing for light, space, nutrients and water, thus affecting the productivity. A dense weed cover could also interfere with routine field practices such as fertilizer application, plucking, pruning, forking etc., and could also serve as alternate hosts for some tea pests and disease organisms.\\n\\n# 2. Build-up of Weeds\\n\\nThe abundant occurrence of weeds in tea fields could be attributed to factors such as extensive areas of exposed soil resulted from poor bush stand, high rainfall, delayed weed control rounds and surrounding neglected areas serving as weed seed-banks. The introduction of weed seeds and vegetative parts with applied compost and mulch, and resorting continuously to a single herbicide that could lead to resistance development, are other attributes for such development. A general understanding of the possible causes for weed build-up is important for the tea grower to select and integrate two or more of the appropriate weed management methods.\\n# 3 Integrated Weed Management Methods\\n\\nWeed management in tea lands has to be achieved in an integrated manner. The various practices adopted include manual, mechanical, chemical, cultural, ecological and biological methods. Amongst preventive measures, the following methods are very important as their adoption could help to minimize the cost of weeding:\\n\\nIntegrated Weed Management (IWM) refers to a combination of some or all the above methods in a rotational manner throughout the year. IWM utilizes the available know-how on weeds and their management to achieve cost-effective and eco-friendly weed control (Figure 1).\\n\\n# 3.1 Weed Control Calendar\\n\\nThe decision-making process for weed management in tea is based on the weed control calendar prepared for different regions according to the rainfall pattern, growth stage and bush cover of tea (Figure 2).\\n\\nIn order to prevent build-up of resistant weed species, maintain the number of herbicide applications for the year to a minimum (maximum two from a single herbicide), and use a range of herbicides of different mode of action in rotation than continuing with a single herbicide.\\n\\n# 3.2 Special Considerations\\n\\nIn order to arrive at effective weed management method/s, due consideration should be given to cost factor; impacts on soil and environment; bush cover and growth stage of tea and the possible risk of building up of resistance in weeds etc. Effective weed management also depends on the accurate identification of weeds (Table 1) and basic understanding of their life cycle.\\n             8 6H                                             U W 0Ji Zhi\\n     1     H 3                                                  6\\n           j4IL                          0 1                                   2IBa\\n                                         h 5\\n     1      1 S                                                 J 1\\n            ] L\\n            6 g\\n                                                                       25 838 0\\n 8    ]                                   ] 8 8\\n 19           Jl0                         H 8\\nL\\n 1    1      1 I 1 6\\n             3\\n             2 JL                                                                     2\\n                   [ 1             1 8                                                5\\n      ]\\n      3      Milii 1 {\\n             2 1 1\\n                  1 2       H\\n                            8\\n                                  3             8 2 1 1 I                             L\\n                                                                                       {\\n              WJ 6 1 1 HNW               82 2 ]                                       3\\n      L 1     11 1\\n                  1 6I1        W 8312 L                    3                          2 1\\n               1 1 3                                                                 2\\n# Weed Management Calendars for different tea growing regions\\n\\n# a) Low Country\\n\\nPre emergent herbicide\\nMulch\\nJan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\n\\n# b) Mid Country\\n\\nPost emergent herbicide\\nMulch\\nJan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\n\\n# c) Up Country\\n\\nPre emergent herbicide\\nMulch\\nJan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\n\\n# d) Uva\\n\\nPost emergent herbicide\\nCultural/Mechanical\\nJan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\n\\n# Post-emergent herbicide\\n\\nCultural/Mechanical\\nPost emergent herbicide\\nManual\\nMay\\nJun\\nJul\\nAug\\nSep\\nOct\\nNov\\nDec\\n\\n# Post emergent herbicide / Cultural / Mechanical\\n\\nPost emergent herbicide\\nManual\\nMay\\nJun\\nJul\\nAug\\nSep\\nOct\\nNov\\nDec\\n\\n# Post emergent herbicide / Cultural / Mechanical\\n\\nPost emergent herbicide\\nManual\\nMay\\nJun\\nAug\\nSep\\nOct\\nNov\\nDec\\n\\n# Pre emergent herbicide\\n\\nManual\\nMulch\\nMay\\nJun\\nAug\\nSep\\nOct\\nNov\\nDec\\n# 3.3 Preventive Measures\\n\\nThe objective of adopting preventive measures is to minimize accumulation of a seed bank i.e: weed seeds and propagules in tea lands. It would in turn assist in lowering the cost of management of the present and future weed population in tea fields. Appropriate preventive measures that could be adopted are as follows:\\n\\n- Undertake weeding when weeds are in tender and before the stage of flowering (mature stage).\\n- Keep boundaries of tea fields, roadsides, ravines and other areas adjacent to tea fields free of weeds to prevent the continuous dispersal of weed seeds into tea fields. Any over-grown weeds in such areas should be kept slashed or in the alternative to prevent seeding for keeping them under check.\\n- Plant cover crops in all exposed areas and utilizing uncultivated areas for thatch banks, or forestry, to suppress indiscriminate weed growth.\\n- Adopt a year-round weed management programme using weed management calendar appropriate to the region for timely attention.\\n- Use compost and mulching materials in a more rational way, by taking due care not to bring weed seeds and other vegetative parts such as rhizomes, yams, propagules etc. that are capable of regeneration into tea fields.\\n\\n# 3.4 Cultural Ecological Weed Control Methods\\n\\nThe objective of adopting cultural ecological techniques is to enable quick establishment of proper ground cover of land, to suppress the growth of weeds. This could be achieved by adoption of following practices:\\n\\n- Infilling vacant patches in tea fields with quick growing, early spreading cultivars that would attain a quick ground cover and thereby shade out the weeds. In old tea fields, where the vacancies are not expected to be infilled in near future, a suitable grass such as Mana (Cymbopogon confertiflorus), Guatemala (Tripsicum laxum), Hybrid napier CO-3 (Pennisetum perpureum X Pennisetum americarnum) or Vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) grass may be planted to avoid such vacant patches becoming breeding grounds for weeds. These grasses will suppress weeds due to their smothering and allelopathic effects.\\n- Planting of green manure crops, such as Crotalaria micans (Adanahiriya), Tithonia diversifolia (wild sun flower), Wild chrysanthemum Mari Kolondu (Artemisa vulgaris) or Flemingia macrophylla in vacant patches and as a hedge row for thatching in tea fields is also useful. Cover crops such as Mal ratakaju (Arachis pintoi) could also be planted on two feet wide strips in middle of the tea inter rows and Eth undupiyalaiya (Grona ovalifolia) and Indigofera sp. in non-tea areas such as roadsides, borders, abandoned lands etc.\\n- Using suitable mulching materials such as Mana, Guatemala, Godapara (Dillenia suffruticosa), Flemingia macrophylla etc.; artificial agriculture mulch could be used to cover the inter-row spaces as effective mulching sources.\\n- Adoption of all possible measures to encourage the early development of frames in the tea bush maintaining bush stand is essential in minimizing the potentials of weed emergence. This could be achieved using healthy and well spreading nursery plants in new clearings, proper infilling programs, adoption of Good Agricultural Practices ensuring implementation of timely bringing-into-bearing to enhance spread of peripheral branches of the bush.\\n# 3.5 Manual Weeding\\n\\nManual weeding could be undertaken either by exclusively \"hand-pulling\" weeds or by \"slash weeding\", as described below:\\n\\nHand pulling is the removal of weeds totally by hand. Although a costly operation, it is a safer method than chemical weeding:\\n\\nClean weeding by using a scraper should be strongly discouraged. Selective weeding should be advocated, where shallow rooted soft herbs such as *Centella asiatica (Gotukola), Drymaria cordata (Kadalai kodi), Grona triflora (Heen undupiyaliya), Euphorbia scordiifolia (Heendada keeriya), Oxalis sp. (Ambul ambiliya), Stemodia verticillata, Mollugo pentaphylla* etc. which are beneficial are retained to serve as a live ground cover:\\n\\nDigging the soil to remove tuberous or rhizomatous weeds is not advocated because such practice could aggravate weed infestation arising through regrowth of fragmented underground plant parts that are capable of regeneration:\\n\\nWeeds that are resistant to herbicides should be hand pulled, along with other free-growing weeds. All creeping weeds such as *Anredera cordifolia (Passali kodi), Camonea pilosa (Maha-MadulKiri-madu-vael), Ipomoea sp. (Railway glory/ Morning glory), Mikania sp. (Watupalu/Lokapalu), Neustanthus phaseoloides (Pohora-wel), Xenostegia tridentata* (Heen madu wel) etc. should be removed manually:\\n\\nAll the weeds that are removed from a tea field should be piled up in a wooden cage within the tea block. It is necessary to mix up the heap once in a while, to check and remove re-growing tuberous rhizomatous weeds: Weeds should be used for composting only after picking out the yams, bulbils and other vegetative parts capable of regeneration, and destroying them.\\n\\n# 3.6 Mechanical Weeding\\n\\nSlash weeding is the removal of weeds by cutting them at the base with a hoelcutter in mechanical weeder: Woody, grass and deep-rooted perennial weeds, that resist removal by hand or herbicide, should be slashed. Continual slashing will result in a gradual decline in weed seed population in the soil.\\n\\nMechanical Weeding using grass cutters (with a proper guard) is more suitable for tea lands with large vacant patches. It should be noted that recovery of weeds is faster with continual use of slashing:\\n\\n# 3.7 Chemical Weed Control\\n\\nChemical weed control among other various weed management techniques available under IWM is economically important in tea. Selection of herbicides should be based on the type of weed species, growth stage of tea, growth cycle of weeds and the weed control calendar introduced to respective regions. Precautionary measures should be adopted in the use of herbicides to avoid any non-target effects to the crop, humans and the environment:\\n\\nPlease refer to Advisory Circular PU 3 for details of different herbicides recommended for tea, modes of action, dosages and precautionary measures:\\n\\n# 3.8 Biological Weed Control\\n\\nBiological weed control is defined as an activity aimed at decreasing the weed species population to an acceptable level through the use of a living organism. In tea fields, there are only a few:\\nCompetitive plant species that can control another weed species by competing with it for one or more growth factors (water, nutrients and light): Biological control in tea could be termed more appropriately as ecological control. Control of African couch (Digitaria abyssinica) by planting Brachiaria brizantha is one such example in tea lands.\\n\\nTea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\\n\\nTalawakelle\\n\\n\\nAll rights reserved.

        "        Purpose: SimpleKVCache is an in-memory key-value store used to cache intermediate results or data during processing. It helps in reducing redundant computations by storing and retrieving data quickly.\n",
        "        Scope: It is typically used within the context of data processing pipelines to cache results that can be reused, thus improving performance.\n",
        "        Persistence: SimpleKVCache does not inherently support persistence to disk. It is designed for temporary storage and loses data when the application is restarted.\n",
        "\n",
        "    StorageContext.persist:\n",
        "        Purpose: This method is used to persist the state of storage components managed by the StorageContext, such as vector stores, document stores, and other data storage elements.\n",
        "        Scope: It focuses on saving the data and state of these storage components to ensure data durability across application restarts.\n",
        "        Use Case: Ideal for persisting data that needs to be durable, such as indexed documents or vectors, allowing them to be reloaded later.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Pipeline.persist:\n",
        "        Purpose: This method is used to persist the state of an ingestion pipeline, including its configuration and any intermediate states or results that need to be saved for later use.\n",
        "        Scope: It involves saving the state of the transformations, cache, and any other components directly associated with the pipeline's operation.\n",
        "        Use Case: Useful when you want to save the entire pipeline setup and its state, so you can resume processing or debugging without reinitializing everything from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, SimpleKVCache is for temporary in-memory caching, StorageContext.persist is for persisting data managed by storage components, and Pipeline.persist is for saving the operational state of the pipeline itself. Each serves a distinct purpose within the data processing and management workflow."
